      by Steffan O'Sullivan</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Five-point Fudge is an alternative character creation system by Steffan O'Sullivan. It's used here as a basis for a sample Fudge fantasy role-playing game.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Five-point Fudge is suitable for any genre, but each genre requires customized skill lists, gifts, faults, and attributes. The version presented here is for a Fantasy genre only. These lists should not be considered as canon - everything in Fudge is fully customizable, and these lists are offered only as an easy introduction to Fudge.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Fudge itself makes no mention of "character points," using the word "levels" instead. The Five Point Fudge system of character creation introduces character creation points, which are different from levels.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Fantasy Fudge is an example of one way a Gamemaster may decide to customize Fudge to a fantasy campaign world. The game design choices made in Fantasy Fudge shouldn't be considered the "best" way to play Fudge in a fantasy game, as players' and GMs' tastes vary.

      You may use the sample Fudge character sheet in the Miscellaneous Charts and Information at the end of this document to record your character's traits. With the Skills list, you should record the number of points you spend in which skill groups (see <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secfftipsonpointspending">8.1.1.3</a> - Tips on Point Spending). For example:

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      The Five Point Fudge system of character creation organizes skills into skill "groups" to help players decide which skills are best for the characters they wish to create. There are eight skill groups in Fantasy Fudge: Athletic; Combat; Covert; Knowledge; Magic; Professional; Scouting; and Social (see <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secfftheskillgroups">8.1.1.8</a> - The Skill Groups).
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Fantasy Fudge recommends that players be granted 5 points to purchase skills from these various skill groups. If you wish beginning characters to be more or less powerful than those presented here, please see Campaign Power Levels in the full version of Five Point Fudge, online at.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      A player can spend his points in any of the groups that he chooses, up to four points in any one group. (He must spend points in at least two groups.) Each quantity of points spent provides a certain number of skills (of the player's choice) from the appropriate group, at the levels shown below.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Because a character with too few skills may be weak in a given campaign, the GM may limit the number of points you can spend on narrowly focused skill groups. (Suggested limit: two points, either 1 in each of 2 Groups or 2 "narrow focus" points in a single Skill Group.)

    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Examples of point expenditure: if a player wishes his character to be a dabbler at Combat, he could spend one point on the Combat group. Using a broad focus, he could then choose any three Combat skills at Fair and any one at Mediocre. Using a narrow focus, he may choose any two Combat skills: one at Good and one at Mediocre.

      The more points a player spends in a given skill group, the more his character gains both familiarity with a number of skills and greater expertise in some of those skills. For example, a Combat specialist is a professional soldier who will be an expert with a few weapons, but will have also used many other weapons over the course of his career.

      The player may choose any skills within a given skill group, up to the number listed for the points spent. The player may decide which of those skills are at the listed levels. If the GM doesn't want a character to know a given skill, she should make sure the player understands this before character creation.

    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Thus there are thousands of player character types available in this system, yet all are easily customized to the player's desires. If you want your character to be a Jack of All Trades, don't spend more than two points in any skill group. If you want a specialist, spend at least three points in a skill group.

This means you may spend one point and take any<span class="Footnoteanchor"><a target="_self" href="#ftn2" id="bodyftn2" name="bodyftn2">[2]</a></span> three skills at Fair. These skills can be from two or three different skill groups, if desired (there is no point in taking them all from the same group).

    </h4>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      During character creation you may trade one skill for two skills of lesser value. Thus you could trade one Good skill for two Fair skills, or one Great skill for two Good skills. For example, spending two points in a skill group normally gets you 2 Good and 4 Fair skills. You could instead choose 2 Good, 3 Fair, and 2 Mediocre skills.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Skills involved in the trade must all be from the same skill group. Exception: with a General Skills point (see above), you can trade a Fair for two Mediocre skills from two different groups. Thus a character could take six Mediocre skills from six different groups with a General Skills point.

    </h4>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      The Gamemaster may customize skill points and character creation as desired. If narrowly focused points seem too costly (giving up half the skills of a broadly focused point for an increase of one level in one skill), add another skill at Fair. Do skill levels seem too low for your epic campaign? After they've created their characters, let your players raise five skills of their choosing one level each (subject to your approval).

    </h4>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      There are many ways to create a character. If you have a concept in mind, scan the skill lists that seem most likely to fit your character. A fighter will obviously need to spend some points in Combat skills, and a thief in Covert skills.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Since you must spend points in at least two skill groups, try to think of what other skills would be helpful - or perhaps simply fun - for your character to have.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Once you've decided which skill groups to choose from, jot down the most appealing skills in these groups. The number of skills you want from a given group will tell you how many points you need to spend in that skill group. For example, if only two or three skills appeal to you from a group, spending 1 or 2 narrowly focused points is sufficient. If you really want eight or ten skills all from the same group, you're creating a specialist character: you'll probably have to spend three or four points in that skill group to get that many skills. (Another way to get eight or ten skills, if you don't mind low skill levels, is to use the "trading skills" option.) A Jack of All Trades character rarely spends more than two points in any one group, and is interested in skills from three or more different skill groups.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Once your skills are chosen, you can then set your attributes, Gifts, and Faults. At that point you'll easily be able to see what levels your attributes should logically be, and which Gifts and Faults would go most appropriately with your character.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      It's best to consult with the Gamemaster and the other players when creating characters. This can prevent problems with characters that are unsuited for the planned campaign, or PCs that encroach on one another's "spotlight" time because their skills and abilities compete with rather than complement those of the other characters. The Gamemaster should approve all characters before play begins.

A 3-point Animal Handler can make a strong claim that Riding (an Athletic skill) should be in his Professional skill group, but he'll have to spend at least one point in Combat to get any combat skills.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      There are six attributes in Fantasy Fudge. The GM may customize this list as she wishes - changing the attributes included, adding or deleting them at will.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Reasoning:</span> <span class="c6">Thinking ability; puzzle-solving; intelligence; mental acuity.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Perception:</span> <span class="c6">Awareness of the environment; raw ability to notice things.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Willpower:</span> <span class="c6">Strength of will; psychic stamina; determination; guts.</span>

    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Strength:</span> <span class="c6">Physical strength; lifting/ carrying capacity; ability to deal damage.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Agility:</span> <span class="c6">Physical dexterity; adroitness; native talent for physical skills.</span>

    </h4>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      All attributes start at Fair. Each character may take two free attribute levels, either raising one attribute two levels, or two attributes one level each. (The GM may allow more or fewer free attribute levels - see Campaign Power Levels in the online version of Five-point Fudge.)
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      In addition, players may trade levels - that is, lower an attribute to Mediocre in order to raise one other attribute one level, and so on. Also, subject to GM approval, a character may raise an attribute by taking an additional Fault, or by foregoing one of the two free Gifts.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Conversely, a player may forego one of his free two attribute levels in order to take an extra Gift - again, subject to GM approval.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Attributes are not linked to skills in this game. The player is encouraged to choose attribute levels which make sense, given his skill list. For example, three or more points spent between Combat, Scouting and Athletic skills means that the character would logically be above average in Strength, Agility, and/or Health. If the player decides not to raise at least one of these attributes above Fair, he should have a good story as to why they are abnormally low.

    </h4>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Attributes are used for three things in the game:
    </p>
    <ul class="c8">
      <li>
        <p class="MyList c87">
          As very broad skills. There will be times in which no particular skill listed in the rules is appropriate for the task the character is attempting. In these cases, the GM will choose the closest attribute and have the player roll versus the attribute.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="MyList c87">
          In certain opposed actions, such as attempting to sneak by a guard (Move Quietly skill vs. Perception attribute) or a swindle attempt (Con skill vs. Reasoning attribute) or an attempt to strangle someone (Strength attribute vs. Health attribute). The GM will think of other cases readily.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="MyList c87">
          As a broad handle on who the character is. A high Reasoning, low Strength character has a different flavor from the opposite attribute levels.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Each character may have two Gifts from the following list, or other GM-approved Gift. In addition, for each Fault chosen beyond the first two, the character may have an additional Gift. The GM may limit the number Gifts available from this method, as things can get a little out of hand?…. You may also gain a Gift, with GM approval, by foregoing one of your free attribute levels.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Certain Gifts, marked with an asterisk (*), may be lost if abused. Contacts, Favors Due, and Patron depend on the goodwill of others, and it's possible to push them too far or too frequently. Good Reputation can be eroded by inappropriate behavior, and Rank can be lost if you break the rules of the organization granting the rank.

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Innate Magic takes no study - it's a Gift you're born with. The Gamemaster may assign this as a racial gift to non-human races (such as Elves) if she wishes. All members of such a race would have the Magical Talent: Innate Gift (or a serious Fault if they don't).
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Hedge Magic and Scholarly Magic are learned techniques. Their Talents are handled differently and are not interchangeable. Not everyone has the ability to perform these types of magic - you need the Magical Talent Gift.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Clerical Magic is actually performed by a deity through the character. You need the Divine Favor Gift to use Clerical Magic.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      This type of magic may be appropriate for Faerie races, who have an inborn talent for magic that has nothing to do with the learned magic of human magicians. It's also possible to have a human character with Innate Magic, if the GM permits.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Each Innate Magical power requires the Gift, Magical Talent: Innate. Each such Gift provides only one type of Innate Magic, taken from the list below. The GM may ban some of these talents, or create others - ask. Note that some types of Innate Magic have been listed as separate Gifts, such as Danger Sense, Empathy with Animals, etc.

    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Fire-Starter:</span> <span class="c6">you can create fire, though not control it. That is, you can cause something flammable to burst into flames (takes three combat rounds for small items), but can't make fireballs or direct the fire to spread in a given direction.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Fortune Telling:</span> <span class="c6">you can see a possible future, as through a glass, darkly. This only works on others, and never on events which are important to you - your own future is always obscured.</span>

    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Green Thumb:</span> <span class="c6">plants respond extraordinarily well to you, with increased growth, health, and production.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Healing Hands:</span> <span class="c6">you can heal one level of wounds with a touch. This takes one minute and is fatiguing (see</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secffhedgemagic">Hedge Magic</a><span class="c6">, below, for fatigue effects).</span>
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Second Sight:</span> <span class="c6">you can see through illusions and "read" general personalities. You can't read minds or know any details of personality, but you'll know who to trust if you concentrate.</span>

    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Shapeshifter:</span> <span class="c6">you can change into one GM-approved animal or plant form. It takes three combat rounds to change fully, during which you are defenseless. [Costs two Gifts]</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      You don't need to spend any points on skills to have Innate Magic - you only have to buy the Gift. No skill roll is usually required - the talent is automatic, although it may take time. Should it ever be an issue, each talent is known at a Great level.

      You may add to this list any innate magic abilities for non-human races in your campaign world.

    <p class="Textbody c7">
      GURPS Hedge Magic can be found at:
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Hedge Magic is the "peasant" version of magic: hedgerow witches and village wizards concocting herbal potions, creating charms, nullifying (or, alas, casting) curses, etc.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      You may spend up to four points in the Hedge Magic group, but only as many points as you have levels of the Magic Talent: Hedge Magic Gift. That is, if you take only one level of Magic Talent: Hedge Magic Gift, you may only spend one point on Hedge Magic skills.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The skill list for Hedge Magic follows, and is treated like any other skill group. That is, one point spent in Hedge Magic allows you to choose 3 skills at Fair and 1 at Mediocre, etc. Each skill is a mundane skill found in other skill groups - if you learn it in the Hedge Magic group, there is no need to learn it from another group.
    </p>

      You may use a mundane skill from this group without applying Hedge Magic. But if you use Hedge Magic, you can accomplish more than you could otherwise. Hedge Magic is not flashy magic - you'll never see major magical effects from it. It's nonetheless effective in what it tries to do.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Hedge Magic is fatiguing, however - your Health attribute drops one level, temporarily, for each use. If your Health level falls below Terrible, you are exhausted and collapse - treat as the fatigue equivalent of "Incapacitated." A level of fatigued Health is regained simply by resting 15 minutes.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Another possible downside to Hedge Magic is that the results may be perceived as magical, which, depending on the situation, may get the caster in trouble.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The following mundane skills are the only ones which may be enhanced by Hedge Magic, unless the GM permits otherwise. Those without descriptions are simply assumed to provide enhanced results.

    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Scholarly Magic is the "upper class" version of magic: sorcerers in towers poring over ancient tomes, wizards roaming the world seeking out spell-crafters and new sources of power, colleges of magicians teaching apprentices while debating among themselves the merits of this spell or that, etc.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">A sample Scholarly Magic system is presented below. It's a flexible magic system, with no preset spell list, and thus leaves a lot of decisions up to the GM. Gamemasters are welcome to substitute any other magic system of choice. The sourcebook A Magical Medley from Grey Ghost Games contains a chapter on creating Fudge magic systems, as well as six sample systems. The Gramarye is particularly recommended; you can also find it online at . Also recommended: Fudge Magic (see section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="fudge_srd_10.html#secfudgemagic"><span class="Internetlink">7.1</span></a> <span class="c6">of the core Fudge rules), GURPS (R) Magic, and Four-by-Five Magic ().</span>

    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Characters wishing to learn Scholarly Magic must have the Magical Talent: Scholarly Magic Gift. You may spend up to four points in the Scholarly Magic group, but only as many points as you have levels of the Magic Talent: Scholarly Magic Gift. If you spend only one Gift on Magic Talent: Scholarly Magic, you may only spend one point on Scholarly Magic skills. Note that Scholarly Magic skills cost more; see below.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Characters without Magical Talent may learn the Thaumatology Knowledge Skill instead. This will allow them to recognize magic spells, skills, and possibly magic items and talismans (especially if powerful or well known), but not cast magic themselves.

    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      The Scholarly Magic skills are difficult areas of study, covering magical incantations, rituals, arcane knowledge, and more. There is no default for these skills, so a character learning Scholarly Magic in-game (as opposed to pre-game character creation) would learn the skill at Terrible. They cost more at character creation, as well.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Note that you may trade 1 Scholarly Magic skill for 2 skills at one level lower. And remember that you can spend only as many points in Scholarly Magic as you have Gifts in Magical Talent: Scholarly Magic.

      The Gamemaster should decide which of the Scholarly Magic skills presented here are allowed. The "Black Arts" (Sorcery and Necromancy) may be restricted to NPC villains, for example. Likewise, the Scholarly Magic Skill of Alchemy may be off limits. (PCs should be allowed to take the Knowledge Skill version of Alchemy, which allows them to recognize various alchemical potions and know something about the procedures and ingredients involved in making them, but not actually create magical elixirs.)
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The GM may also decide that each culture in the game world knows only a few of the many "flavors" of Scholarly Magic. For example, Shamanism may be restricted to the "primitive" tribes on the jungle continent, or to the horse nomads on the great steppes. Another culture may know Mesmerism, but outlaw its use. A centuries-old university of mages may combine Conjuration and Kineticism into a single branch of study, and likewise with Extra Sensory Perception and Mesmerism. Perhaps Runes are a lost art, and no one living now understands the strange markings found on ancient obelisks and monuments and over archways leading to catacombs.

    </h4>
    <p class="Firstparagraph">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Alchemy:</span> <span class="c6">The art of mixing balms, draughts, elixirs, nostrums, ointments, philters, potions, powders, salves, tinctures, tonics, and more, with varying magical effects. Non-mages can have knowledge of the processes and ingredients and final products of alchemy, but are not able to create magical substances themselves; see the Alchemy (Knowledge) skill.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Magical Feats</span>: The GM can have elixirs in the game which produce any magical effect she wants. Alchemical mixtures are used up when applied; unless provided in multiple "doses," they only work once.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">In-Game Requirements</span>: Alchemical processes take a lot of time and materials to prepare. A fully equipped alchemical lab requires great wealth, which means either a high status or a patron to support them. Each alchemical concoction takes weeks or months to prepare, with a high rate of failure, and rare materials that render mass-production impractical. Player character alchemists are not likely to prepare many alchemical substances, simply because of the time and effort involved.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Restrictions</span>: The Gamemaster may require an alchemist to also have a Magic or Knowledge Skill appropriate to the alchemical effect desired. For example, a potion of healing may require skill in Herb Lore, Medicine, or First Aid - or the equivalent Hedge Magic skills, hence requiring a Magical Talent: Hedge Magic Gift as well. A philter of flying may require Kineticism (see below) or collaboration with a Kineticist.
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Artificing:</span> <span class="c6">Bestowing magical properties on items.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Magical Feats</span>: As with alchemy, the GM may allow any enchanted items she wishes in the game. There are three categories of magic items: charms and talismans, with long-lasting but subtle magic; "One-shot" items such as scrolls that release their magical effect all at once (some may be enchanted to work more than once, but will stop working under pre-set conditions, or after a set number of magical feats are performed); and permanent magical items, such as magical swords, cloaks of flying, and the like. "Magic vessels" are permanent enchanted items that are relatively easy to create; they collect and store mana (magical power; see below) for later use, providing scholarly mages with a "magic battery" of sorts.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">In-Game Requirements</span>: As with alchemy, artificing requires lengthy rites. Even a simple talisman or charm takes several weeks to ritually prepare, although actually embuing it with magical power may require only a short ceremony and a GM-determined expenditure of mana. Powerful, permanent enchantments require the item to be specifically created and prepared with the enchantment in mind, and may require the item to be crafted out of rare or precious materials. It's not enough to take any old sword and slap an ever-sharp enchantment on it; the sword must be forged in a prescribed manner, with rituals of artificing and enchantment performed on it throughout its creation. Artificing also requires much mana, which is usually expended in several stages throughout the artificing process.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Restrictions</span>: Artificing requires the mage to also be skilled in the type of magic bestowed on the item. A wand that turns the target into a frog requires the Transmutation skill; a bag of winds requires the Elemental skill; and so on. Magical scrolls that allow the reader to cast spells require two skills; the Rune skill (for knowing the symbols to use to "write" the spell on the scroll) and the appropriate magic type skill (Mesmerism for a sleep spell, etc.). The GM may also require the artificer to be skilled in crafting the item to be enchanted. Magic swords may need an Artificer who is also a swordsmith (Smithy professional skill). If the artificer collaborates with another magician or with a skilled craftsman in creating an enchanted item, each participant must match or exceed the Difficulty Level set by the GM at each stage of the artificing in order for the final enchantment to work.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Note:</span> The ability to create magic vessels is included in the Artificing skill, as the ability to store mana in an enchanted item is at the heart of all artificing.
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Conjuration:</span> <span class="c6">Creating objects (even creatures!) out of "thin air" - or making objects disappear.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Magical Feats</span>: A conjurer can produce magical energy (in the form of heat, or light, or both) or non-magical items (such as water, air, food, or anything else the GM allows), or creatures (normal animals, magical creatures, and even sentient creatures). The Gamemaster decides whether such conjurations actually create these things, or whether they're "called" from another dimension or world. Most conjurations have a limited duration, and will disappear after a GM-set amount of time. Fairy Gold is an example; it looks and feels and tastes like real gold, but disappears when the spell has run its course.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The GM may allow conjurations to be "renewed" by expending more mana. Conjuration may also be used to banish items or creatures, including creatures and spirits called up by Elementalism, Necromancy, Shamanism, or Sorcery. Such "banishments" are resolved as an Opposed action - the Conjuration Skill versus the original skill roll that called the creatures or items into being.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">In-Game Requirements</span>: Conjurations typically have short casting times (an hour or less), but require a lot of mana (magical power) to perform.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Restrictions</span>: Conjuration creates or calls items and creatures - it doesn't control them. For a conjurer to have control over his creations, he'll need Elementalism (to control any element conjured), Kineticism (to animate items), or Mesmerism (to control conjured creatures).
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Elementalism:</span> <span class="c6">Elementalists specialize in controlling and transforming the four elements: Earth, Air, Fire, and Water.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Magical Feats</span>: Just about anything involving controlling or transforming Earth, Air, Fire, or Water can be done with Elementalism. Working with Earth, one could turn rock to dirt (or vice versa); cause (or calm!) an earthquake or rockslide; or turn a hard metal brittle. Air magic includes stirring a gentle breeze into a fiercer wind, or directing it to carry your words to a particular person's ears in a whisper spell. An Elementalist's campfire could remain bright and warm without consuming fuel; or shoot forth a spark to set some nearby flammable material alight. Water magic includes feats such as purify water and turning water to ice. Many materials have the properties of multiple elements - mud is Earth and Water; lightning is Air and Fire; a living creature is made up of all four elements; etc. The more elements a Feat involves, the more difficult it will be.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">In-Game Requirements</span>: Elemental magic is often quick to perform. Mana costs vary with the scope of the feat being performed. Parting a river to allow safe crossing will take much more mana than magically bringing a small cup of water to a boil. (Parting a river - or a larger body of water - can be done by many elementalists working in concert, or with a fabled and powerful Staff of Water Command.)
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Restrictions</span>: Creating some amount of an element (a fireball, for example) requires the Conjuration skill. Transforming one element into another requires the Transmutation skill. Calling forth an Elemental - a powerful construct imbued with the very essence of one of the four Elements - requires Shamanism or Sorcery.

    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Extra Sensory Perception:</span> <span class="c6">Perceiving things with more than the usual five senses.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Magical Feats</span>: Examples of "Esper" magic include Empathy, Telepathy, Clairvoyance (seeing at a distance), Clairaudience (hearing at a distance), Astral Travel (moving out of body, or taking a soul journey to another plane), Divination, and Sensing Auras. An Esper mage also knows how to block Esper magic. Espers excel at detecting the presence or patterns of magic and mana.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">In-Game Requirements</span>: Esper magic requires concentration and focus. Typical rituals are relatively short (a matter of a few minutes), but may require a period of purification and meditation before beginning. Espers are vulnerable when experiencing out-of-body travel, and should arrange protection or safety for their physical bodies while their spirits roam.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Restrictions</span>: The information received through Esper magic is not always crystal-clear, and may be subject to misinterpretation. Any distractions, even slight ones, while the Esper is attempting extra sensory perception requires a Willpower roll to ignore (Difficulty Level equal to that set for the magical feat itself).
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Kineticism:</span> <span class="c6">The magic of motion.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Magical Feats</span>: Levitation, Telekinesis, Teleportation, Animation of objects, and magical "Force" shields or weapons are all possible.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">In-Game Requirements</span>: Most kinetic feats require concentration, especially when they involve precisely targeted movement. Mana is expended to start something in motion, and then concentration and willpower are used to direct that motion. Teleportation requires the Kineticist to be at the originating point (although he can Teleport either himself or another), and also to have recently been to the destination point. Without a clear picture of the destination in mind, a Kineticist may "miss" during a Teleportation, with potentially dire consequences such as appearing a bit too far above (or below!) ground level….
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Restrictions</span>: In the case of magical "force" weapons (such as a magic missile of harm), the GM may require the player to roll once against the character's Kineticism skill (to create the magic force) and again using either the character's Kineticism skill or Willpower attribute to direct the missile. A magical "force" shield could be accomplished as one task - the creation of a magic force that moves with the target and blocks contact with anything physically harmful. If a Kineticist wishes to animate an object but also grant it some self-direction or even intelligence, the Shamanism or Sorcery skill is required to bind a spirit to the animated object.
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Mesmerism:</span> <span class="c6">Affecting minds with magic. Mesmerism may be opposed by the Willpower attribute.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Magical Feats</span>: This skill covers Hypnosis, Illusion, Mind-Control (of humans or animals), and other mind-affecting magic. The ubiquitous "Sleep" spell falls under this skill. "Invisibility" can also be accomplished with Mesmerism. At its simplest level, Mesmerism can confuse a creature's senses. At its most insidious, it can completely enslave a creature's mind, bending it to the Mesmerist's will.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">In-Game Requirements</span>: Mesmerism works only against living creatures that also have at least a rudimentary mind. A Mesmerist must be within a certain distance of his targets to be able to affect their minds - the distance varies with the difficulty of the feat being attempted. The more complex the "confusion of the senses" being attempted, the more difficult the feat. The more creatures to be Mesmerized, the more mana is required. The same goes for intelligence, to a point. Normal animal intelligence, such as that of a dog or a horse, is the easiest for most Mesmerists. Affecting the minds of creatures that are more or less intelligent than "normal animal" requires more mana to overcome the target's intelligence (or lack thereof).
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Restrictions</span>: The GM may rule that certain non-human creatures (especially intelligent ones) simply have minds that are too "alien" for a Mesmerist to affect. Mammals will be the easiest to affect. Insects, with their tiny and differently-wired brains, are not easy at all. Any creature with a Willpower attribute may oppose Mesmerism (resolve as an opposed action, Mesmerism skill vs. target's Willpower attribute), plus any applicable modifiers.
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Necromancy:</span> <span class="c6">"Death Magic." Necromancy is a "Black Art," although not as dangerous to wield as Sorcery.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Magical Feats</span>: Creating (or destroying) and controlling undead creatures, summoning spirits of the dead for divination, and driving a spirit from a living body are all possible with Necromancy. Necromancers can also cause hauntings or release ghostly spirits to the afterlife. The most powerful Necromancers may be able to bring the dead back to life (a far more difficult feat than simply animating their corpses).
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">In-Game Requirements</span>: Necromancers require access to the raw materials typically needed for their magic - dead bodies. Most cultures frown on such uses of earthly remains.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Restrictions</span>: As Necromancy is illegal in many cultures, most Necromancers have the fault Secret (see above). The GM may require Necromancers to have the Kineticism skill to animate corpses (as zombies, skeletons, or other undead creatures), or she may substitute Shamanism as the means by which a spirit is tied to a corpse to create an undead creature. A generous GM will allow Necromancers to use their own methods to call the spirits or raise the dead. Necromancy may be restricted to non-player characters.
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Runes:</span> <span class="c6">The use of arcane symbols (runes, sigils, hieroglyphics, and other marks) to cast spells and enchant items.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Magical Feats</span>: Runes are symbols that are inherently pre-disposed to attracting mana and shaping magical power toward a desired end. Some runes are used to enhance other Scholarly Magic skills, aiding the mage's concentration (lowering the Difficulty Level of a given magical feat), tapping into or focusing magical energy (decreasing the power point cost), or delaying or modifying the effects of a magical feat (triggering the actual spell when certain circumstances are met, for example). Other runes act more like spells, with the drawing of the rune in the prescribed manner being the only ritual required to perform the magical feat associated with that rune. Most Artificers are well versed in runes, as runes are used in preparing spell scrolls and in many other magical items. Artificing can also be used to make a rune and its effects more permanent. For example, a Sigil of Warding drawn above the archway to a room would repel an intruder only once, unless applied in conjunction with the Artificing skill.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">In-Game Requirements</span>: The appropriate rune must be carefully and correctly drawn. Simple runes may be traced in the air or on the ground with a finger. More complex runes may require the mage to draw them in blood on a ritually prepared skin, or painstakingly create them in colored sands on a flat, swept surface, or perform some other equally detailed ritual to create and invoke the rune. Generally, the more complex the magical feat being attempted, the more complex or numerous the runes required, hence the more time required in applying the runes.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Restrictions</span>: Each rune or symbol has a different purpose, and the mage must know the appropriate rune for a given magical feat. The Gamemaster may create a list of runes or other symbols the mage knows, with brief descriptions of how they may be used in the game.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Note:</span> When used in conjunction with other Scholarly Magic skills, the player may roll against the Rune skill even if Runes is not the lowest skill level involved - but only if the runes involved are directly related to the magical feat.
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Shamanism:</span> <span class="c6">Spirit Magic. Shamans interact with spirits of varying powers. Spirits include ancestral spirits, anima (spirits that imbue every object; some anima are more powerful than others), and "guardian spirits."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Magical Feats</span>: A Shaman can cause any magical effect the spirits he deals with are capable of creating. Shamans can also exorcise troublesome spirits and ghosts, and even creatures (or constructs or demons) called through Conjuration, Necromancy, or Sorcery.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">In-Game Requirements</span>: Shamans don't typically need to expend much mana, as any magical feat beyond the initial contact with a spirit is performed by the spirit itself. Once contacted, a spirit may require a bribe, or bargain, or some other method of persuasion to actually perform the requested feat. Spirits must be honored, with each spirit requiring a different ritual. Dancing, sacrificing (of goods, animals, or even sentient creatures), and singing are often essential features of Shamanistic rituals.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Restrictions</span>: The Shamanism roll made when a Shaman character wishes to perform a magic feat determines whether or not the Shaman successfully contacts the desired spirit. An additional skill, such as Flatter, Intimidate, Parley/Negotiate or other persuasive means may be needed to convince the spirit to actually perform the magic feat requested of it. Shamans who fail to uphold their part of any spirit bargain tend not to be able to practice Shamanism well for long. The Gamemaster may require a Shaman to use the Extra Sensory Perception skill for communicating with the spirits through trances and out-of-body experiences. Artificing is required to create shamanistic objects (charms, talismans, and the like) imbued with spirits that perform magic for the wielder.
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Sorcery:</span> <span class="c6">The "Black Arts." Sorcery relies on summoning demons and other powerful, evil beings to trick or bribe or force them into doing the sorcerer's bidding.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Magical Feats</span>: Anything that can be done by a demon, devil, or evil spirit can be accomplished with Sorcery - provided the sorcerer is powerful enough to summon the required entity and crafty enough to convince it to do his bidding. Sorcerers may gain innate magical gifts and other magical powers, either permanently or temporarily, through their dealings with powerful evil beings.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">In-Game Requirements</span>: There are three facets to sorcerous dealings - summoning the evil being; controlling the evil being (by holding it within a circle of power, for example); and persuading it to do the summoner's bidding. The summoned being will seek to twist or distort or otherwise alter any deal struck with the sorcerer, so sorcerers must take care to protect themselves and negotiate their deals carefully.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Restrictions</span>: Penalties of failure are severe, and often gruesome. Evil beings do not take kindly to being summoned against their will, and even less kindly to forced servitude. Should a sorcerer's control slip, even for an instant, the demon or spirit will do its best to harm its captor. Few cultures welcome sorcerers, so the Secret Fault may be required. The Gamemaster may (and probably should) restrict Sorcery to non-player characters, or to PCs with specifically crafted backgrounds (such as a sorcerer-hunter who was once a practicing sorcerer himself).
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Transmutation:</span> <span class="c6">Turning things into other things. Living creatures may oppose such transformations with Willpower.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Magical Feats</span>: The more unalike the original object and the transmutated object are, the harder the feat. Turning living objects into inanimate objects (such as statues) or vice versa is especially difficult. Turning water to wine, or a glutton into a hog, are easier. Such transformations are usually of short duration; it takes much skill and power to affect a permanent transformation.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">In-Game Requirements</span>: Transmutation is a difficult art, often requiring much mana. Affecting a permanent transformation usually requires the use of a powerful enchanted item, such as a staff of transmutation or wand of frog princes.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Restrictions</span>: If the magician's target has a Willpower attribute, it may resist the magical change. Resolve as an Opposed Action, the mage's Transmutation skill versus the target's Willpower attribute, plus or minus any modifiers the GM sets.
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Wizardry:</span> <span class="c6">The "Wise Arts." The most scholarly of scholarly magic, Wizardry concerns itself with the laws of magic, the flow of mana, and the underlying structures of spells, incantations, and enchantments. Wizards know many ways to gather mana, and how to use it efficiently.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Magical Feats</span>: Wizardry can detect or analyze magic and magic items, dispel magic, alter mana flows, and perform similar feats that directly affect the forces that make magic possible. Wizardry can also lower the cost in power points of a given feat (see <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secffmana">Mana</a>, below).
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">In-Game Requirements</span>: When applying Wizardry, the Wizard must take time to consider applicable magical laws, mana flows in the area, and any circumstances present at the time of casting that could affect the outcome.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Restrictions</span>: The GM may require the player to refer to "laws of magic" (Similarity, Contagion, or whatever "laws" are appropriate for the game world), create rhyming "incantations," or otherwise embellish the description of what the mage is doing when using Wizardry in a magical feat.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Note:</span> When used in conjunction with other Scholarly Magic skills, Wizardry may provide a +1 bonus to the character's skill roll.

    </h4>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Casting scholarly magic requires mana, or power points. Truly trivial magic (with effects similar to those attainable with Hedge Magic) uses negligible amounts of mana, but most scholarly magic requires one or more power points.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Each level of the Magical Talent: Scholarly Gift grants the character 5 power points to use in performing magic.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The number of Gifts used to purchase Magical Talent also affects how much mana the character can channel and control. One Magical Talent Gift allows the character to perform trivial magic, and magical feats costing 1 power point. Two Magical Talent Gifts increase that to 2 power points, and so on.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Attempting to channel more power than the character can normally handle requires a Willpower roll, Difficulty Level equal to Fair plus 1 per power point over the character's usual limit. Thus, a character with 2 Magical Talent Gifts attempting to channel 4 power points to perform a magical feat must roll Willpower against a Difficulty Level of Great (Fair +2). Failure results in the loss of one level of Health by each level the Difficulty Level is missed. (A Mediocre result with a Great Difficulty Level would result in the loss of 3 Health levels; see <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secfffatigue">Fatigue</a>, below.)
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Power points may be regained at the rate of 1 point per 2 hours of sleep or 1 hour of undisturbed meditation, up to the number allowed by the magician's Magical Talent Gifts.

    </h4>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      In addition to requiring mana, Scholarly Magic is fatiguing (much like Hedge Magic). The character's Health attribute drops one level for each use. If Health level falls below Terrible, the character is exhausted and collapses - treat as the fatigue equivalent of "Incapacitated." A level of fatigued Health is regained simply by resting 15 minutes.

    </h4>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      When a character wishes to perform magic, the player should describe to the Gamemaster the magical results the character wishes to achieve. The more detail included in the description, the better. Scholarly magic depends heavily on the magician's concentration and clarity of thought, and if the player isn't paying much attention to what the character wishes to accomplish, the GM may assume the character isn't, either.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The player may also describe the magician character's actions, and aspects of the ritual being used to perform the magic feat, if desired. Including poetic incantations (especially if it's good poetry) and other "flavor" in the description of the ritual may be worth bonuses to the character's skill.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      There are several aspects that should be considered for each magical feat:
    </p>
    <ul class="c8">
      <li>
        <p class="MyList">
          Skill required (Difficulty Level)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="MyList">
          Mana required (power points that will be used)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="MyList">
          Time to perform (from an instant to years)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="MyList">
          Materials required (if any)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="MyList">
          Optional modifying circumstances (lots possible)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Skill:</span> <span class="c6">The more complex the desired results, the higher the Difficulty Level the GM should set for a magical feat. Difficulty Levels start at Fair for simple magic, such as creating - but not controlling - fire, or speaking with a spirit that's already "awake" and interested in communicating. Difficulty can range up to Legendary or even beyond, for god-like magical feats. Some "trivial" magic may have Difficulty Levels of Mediocre, but any magic requiring power points should be of at least Fair Difficulty.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Once the Difficulty Level is set, the player rolls against the magician's Scholarly Magic skill. Use the lowest skill if the feat requires more than one Scholarly Magic skill.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Example</span>: Enchanting a Staff of Dragon Summoning and Control requires skill in Artificing, Conjuration, and Mesmerism. An enchanter with Artificing: Mediocre, Conjuration: Fair, and Mesmerism: Good would roll on a skill level of Mediocre.
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Mana:</span> <span class="c6">The more powerful or all-encompassing the desired results, the more power points will be required. "Trivial" magic may require so little mana that power point use isn't even tracked. This doesn't mean a mage can go around popping off trivial spells all day, though, since even trivial spells requiring no power points will fatigue the mage.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Note that the Difficulty Level and the mana required are not related; one measures complexity, the other power. Creating a small colored flame that dances in a pattern that recreates an ancient battle between wizards may be of Legendary Difficulty, but require only one power point.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Note also that some magical feats require more power points than any but the most Legendary Wizards have access to. Such feats are possible, either through pooling the power points of more than one magician, or drawing on "mana vessels" containing stored power points (see Artificing, above). Some rare materials are natural "mana vessels."
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Time:</span> <span class="c6">Generally speaking, the more complex the magical feat desired, the greater the time required in preparing. This is usually true of powerful spells as well. Complex, powerful spells should take a lot of time to prepare. You can trade Time for Difficulty Level, if you wish. The less time you take in preparing the magical incantation, enchantment, or other feat, the greater the Difficulty Level. Likewise, increasing the preparation and casting time may, at the GM's option, lower the Difficulty Level.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Materials:</span> <span class="c6">If the GM wishes, magical feats may require the use of materials related to the effects desired; sulphur or coal for fire, a feather for a flying spell, and so on. Some magical feats may be performed with nothing more than the magician's concentration or some words of power; others may require rare and precious materials.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Modifiers:</span> <span class="c6">The GM may apply any modifiers desired. Examples include bonuses for using special materials (or using materials at all if not normally required); for performing magic in naturally magical surroundings; for applying any "laws of magic" the GM allows (if they have the Wizardry skill). Penalties may be applied for distracting circumstances, or the GM may require a Willpower roll for the mage to avoid becoming distracted and possibly losing control of the magic he's wielding.</span>

    </h4>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      The GM judges whether a feat is within the character's capabilities - if not, she should warn the player that attempting greater magics than the character is ready for is dangerous. The GM also determines what the actual result will be. Magic in Fantasy Fudge is an art, not a science; and the same "spell" cast in the same way may have varying results.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      In general, the greater the success in performing a magical feat, the closer to the desired effects the results will be. Spectacular successes may carry unexpected benefits, such as less time required to cast, lower power point cost, and the like. Abysmal failures should be spectacular, as well. Use your imagination, but don't allow the results to outright kill the character (unless he's a sorcerer)! Less abysmal failures will produce unexpected and possibly unwanted results, including greater power point cost with little or nothing to show for it.

    </h4>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      It's a good idea to take some time before play to work out some "standard" spells a scholarly mage is likely to use. Ask the player what spells the character is likely to have sought out, and work out some sample Difficulty Levels, Mana costs, and required time and materials for those spells. Feel free to "steal" spells from other games to help build a spell list. Consider the spell's desired affect rather than the actual game mechanics used in the game it was designed for, and base the difficulty and power levels on that.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Spell descriptions should be considered guidelines rather than strict definitions of spell effects and costs. Magical feats and their results are meant to be improvised by the Gamemaster as well as by the character.

    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The Gift Divine Favor is required to use Clerical Magic. It's possible to play a priest without Divine Favor - simply choose the Professional skill Counseling/Priest and assemble an appropriate set of skills. But such a priest has no ability to use Clerical Magic. Note also that you don't have to be an ordained priest in any religion to have Divine Favor or to use Clerical Magic.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Skills available to a character with Divine Favor include the mundane and the supernatural. The supernatural are cast strictly through the power of the God or gods served by the cleric. If the cleric's behavior is inconsistent with the God's desires, this ability is withdrawn, at least temporarily.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Supernatural skills in the following list are detailed - any other skill is mundane and uses the description in the Skill list. This list assumes a benign deity who grants free will and supernatural aid to its followers in times of crisis. Other skills may be appropriate for other types of clerics - plant magic for Druids, for example, and more spirit magic for shamans. Evil clerics have a different skill list - your characters should pray they never meet them….

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      When a cleric with Divine Favor calls on his deity, make an Unopposed action roll against the specific Clerical Magic skill (see <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secffunopposed">Unopposed Actions</a>). On a Good or better result, the cleric's petition for divine favor is answered. For clerical skills where exact results aren't quantified (such as Healing), the better the rolled result, the better the answer to the prayer. For example, a Good result may reduce one wound by one wound level, while a Superb result could heal an injured character entirely.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      On a Fair or Mediocre result, the favor simply isn't granted. On a Poor or worse result, the deity may be angry with the cleric. The GM should consider the character's recent actions, especially in regard to the cleric's religious beliefs. If there are any reasons for the cleric's deity to be less than satisfied with service rendered, this is the time for that to become abundantly clear. If the cleric's behavior has been exemplary (so far as the deity is concerned), a failure simply means the deity was busy with other things, or considered the favor unimportant (or counter to its own desires) for some reason.

    </h2>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      The Gamemaster may wish to define a "starting equipment" package that all characters will have (unless they took the Poor Fault or Wealthy Gift). This may include such things as clothing (perhaps one good set and an everyday set), footgear, and weapons appropriate to their Combat skills. They may also have travel or camping gear (such as wineskins or canteens, a messkit, a tinderbox, and other items common in the campaign world).
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Players should be allowed to customize their characters' equipment list a bit, adding things that make sense given their skills. Characters with Climbing skill may have rope, a grappling hook, iron spikes, or similar equipment that can aid in climbing.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Characters should also be allowed to purchase equipment - spending their hard-earned wealth for the privilege, of course. The GM may want to prepare an "equipment list" with average prices for common items available in the campaign world. Appropriate equipment lists may also be borrowed or adapted from other roleplaying games.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      For weapons, armor, and other equipment likely to be used in combat situations, the player or GM should determine Offensive and Defensive Damage Factors.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Damage Factors are simply the sum of damage-related modifiers for each weapon or armor type. These factors will be used to determine damage points and wound levels in combat (see <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secffwounds">Wounds</a>, section).
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">Sample "Wound Factors" are detailed on in section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="fudge_srd_07.html#secwoundfactors"><span class="Internetlink">4.5.3</span></a><span class="c6">. Use these to determine the "Offensive Damage Factor" for each character/weapon combination.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      For example, a character with Good Strength wielding a longsword would have an Offensive Damage Factor of +4 (+1 for Strength; +2 for a large one-handed weapon; +1 for sharpness). A character with Fair Strength wielding the same weapon would have an ODF of +3 (no Strength bonus). Remember to include any bonuses or penalties due to Scale when dealing with non-human combatants.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Then determine the character's "Defensive Damage Factor" for both "unarmored" and "armored" (if the character possesses armor). Modifiers range from +0 for no armor to +4 or more for heavy or magical armor. Scale and Gifts such as Tough Hide can also affect a character's Defensive Damage Factor.

Fantasy Fudge suggests 1-3 Fudge Points per gaming session. The GM may reward really good roleplaying and problem solving with more Fudge Points. Fudge Points may be used to "fudge" a game result, or they may be saved up and traded for Experience Points at a rate of 3 Fudge Points = 1 EP.

    </h2>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      There are two types of actions in Fantasy Fudge - Opposed Actions, and Unopposed Actions.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      A fight between two creatures will most often be resolved as a series of Opposed Actions.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      An attempt to climb a cliff will most often be resolved as an Unopposed Action. The Gamemaster sets the "Difficulty Level" that must be met or surpassed for the action to succeed.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Note that very easy actions should be automatic; no need to roll. Likewise with impossible actions; the character just can't do it, and will fail in the attempt no matter how lucky the player is with dice.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      If the character doesn't have an appropriate skill to attempt a task, the GM may allow the player to roll on the default level for that skill (usually Poor). The GM may call for a roll against an attribute instead of a skill whenever it seems appropriate (asking for an Agility check rather than a Climbing check, for example), although an unskilled character should get a negative modifier to the dice roll.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      The Gamemaster sets a Difficulty Level for any unopposed action. This includes most ranged weapon combat - it's difficult for a character to actually hinder someone's attempt to fire at him, although if he has Quick Reflexes he could attempt to dodge out of the line of fire.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The Difficulty Level should take into account everything but the character's skill (and modifiers to that skill provided by equipment or character condition, including injuries). A task with a Difficulty Level of Poor is very easy, while something with a Difficulty Level of Superb is very hard. For legendary feats, set the Difficulty Level even higher (Superb +2, for example). When in doubt, set the Difficulty Level to Fair. That will give a character with a Fair skill a 62% chance of succeeding.
    </p>

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      When characters engage in opposed actions (including hand-to-hand combat), the players of each contestant roll the dice, add the indicated modifiers to the appropriate skill level, and compare the results. The GM rolls for all NPCs.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Relative Degree measures the difference between the results. If one character has a Good success in an Opposed Action, and the second character has a Mediocre success, the Relative Degree is +2 from the winner's perspective, and -2 from the loser's perspective. In combat, the winner adds the Relative Degree to his Offensive Damage Factor to determine the number of damage points inflicted.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      If it helps, you can convert the characters' combat skills to their numerical equivalents before adding all modifiers (including the random dice roll). Alternatively, put your finger on the Terrible - Superb Trait Scale list, and move up one line for every +1 or down one line for every -1.

    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      In Fudge, a combat "round" can be defined as the Gamemaster wishes. Fantasy Fudge assumes one "round" (roll of the dice) equals about 3 seconds of combat action. Actions occur simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Combat can be resolved as an Unopposed action if it involves ranged combat, a combatant being caught unawares (giving a "free attack" to the opponent), or a "cannon-fodder" type of NPC (see <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secffcombatspecialcircumstances">Special Circumstances</a>, below). Otherwise, treat combat as a series of Opposed Actions.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The players of characters engaged in opposed actions will roll the dice once each combat round; the result determines the winner of that round.

      A Terrible hit never damages the target, even if it beats the opponent's sub-Terrible result.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      When multiple opponents attack a single target, the lone fighter is at -1 to skill for each foe beyond the first. The player rolls once; compare the result with each of the opponents' rolls. The solo combatant has to defeat or tie all of the opponents in order to inflict a wound. If he beats all of his foes, he may hit one of his choice. Otherwise, he can only wound another whose result is at least two levels below his. The lone fighter takes multiple wounds if two or more enemies hit him.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Unlike "star" NPCs, who are treated much like PCs, "cannon fodder" opponents will always get results equal to their trait levels. You can treat this as an Unopposed Action with a Difficulty Level equal to the NPC's combat skill.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      When "cannon fodder" NPCs gang up on a player character, use the "multiple opponents" rule above, but compare the outnumbered fighter's result with the NPCs' combat skill levels (not "rolled degrees").

      A Situational Roll is used to show luck, outside events, or the overall situation. It isn't based on any character traits. Simply roll the dice. A Situational Roll of -2 gives a Poor result; the situation is not good.

      The GM can use a Situational Roll to determine anything from the weather to a non-player character's attitude.

    <p class="Textbody c7">
      A Situational Roll can also be used to check a creature's "morale" during combat, especially when the creature is first wounded, and again if it becomes Very Hurt. A -1 or worse Situational Roll in the midst of combat may mean that the NPC will try to surrender or run away. You may add the NPC's current modifiers due to wounds to the "morale" roll. A Hurt creature with a -1 Situational Roll would actually be experiencing a Poor reaction to the combat, and would probably be doing whatever it could to get out of the fight….

      The basilisk, sometimes called the cockatrice by peasants, is a grayish serpent that grows to no more than two feet in length. It has white markings on its head that resemble a crown. Popular legend holds that the basilisk can kill with a mere glance, but this is untrue. The basilisk's danger lies in its venom. The venomous breath of a basilisk withers plants, scorches the earth and can kill any creature up to the size of an elephant.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      In combat, a basilisk breathes a nearly invisible, cone-shaped cloud of venom that affects foes up to fifteen feet away. Any living creature caught in the cloud must make a Health roll at Great Difficulty or be immediately slain.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Basilisks are also dangerous in melee combat. Any blow that successfully damages the creature can cause the creature's foul venom to pass up through the weapon and affect the wielder. Any time a Basilisk is struck with a melee weapon, the GM should roll a dF. On a roll of -1, the victim must make a Health roll as above or die.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      A basilisk is created from an egg that is laid by a cockerel and then incubated by a toad in a dung heap.

      Ghosts are the leftover psychic residue of someone who has perished. Generally speaking, there is no physical method of removing or harming them. Some ghosts can be put to rest if a special task is completed. Usually the completion of the task is what makes the spirit hang around after its original owner perished. Ghosts are generally resentful creatures and their deep emotional disturbance puts animals at unease.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Ghosts may be influenced, confined, banished, or released by various applications of Clerical Magic or Scholarly Magic (especially Shamanism or Necromancy).

      Ghouls (also know as Ghûls and Raveners) are once-human creatures whose minds have been destroyed. They have grey, jellylike flesh, yellow fangs, and filthy, broken nails which infect their victims with a sinister toxin.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Ghouls usually inhabit underground lairs near graveyards and similar places, where a supply of their noxious "food" may be found. Ghouls usually travel in packs of 3-12, with the most powerful and intelligent member as a leader. Their usual prey is carrion, but they will attack living humans if driven to it by hunger or by a powerful master.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Ghouls attack with their claws and teeth in a mindless frenzy. The poison in their claws drains vitality. The victim must make a Health roll, difficulty level Fair, or lose one level of health per combat round. Victims reduced to below Terrible Health become stiff and helpless.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Any human succumbing to a ghoul attack will be taken to their lair and buried. This live internment, in addition to the ghoulish poison, deranges the mind and causes physical changes that result in the victim becoming a ghoul. If sufficiently hungry, the ghouls may simply devour the victim.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Ghouls can be turned by the Repel Undead Clerical Magic skill, difficulty level Good. The clerical Ward ability keeps ghouls completely at bay. A clerical Healing can neutralize the poison if a victim has not entirely become a ghoul.

      These giant, carnivorous worms grow to be 150 long. They can bore through solid rock and are a menace to explorers in deep caverns.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      A worm's favorite attack is to stick its head out of a hole and swallow any creature of Scale 6 or less. Victims may attempt to dodge (Opposed Action, Victim's Agility versus the worm's Combat Skill). If the worm wins, the victim is swallowed.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      A creature may attempt to attack a worm from the inside., difficulty level Terrible (any attack of Terrible or better has a chance of doing damage) and DDF +1. There is little room to swing weapons. 15 points of cumulative damage done to the same area within the worm allows a victim to cut an escape hole, or might cause the worm to regurgitate.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Meanwhile, the victim is being digested. He or she takes a Scratch each combat round after being swallowed. If the victim has no Scratch boxes left, the Scratch will be a Hurt; if there are no Hurt boxes left on the victim's wound track, the result will be Very Hurt, and so on until death.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      If attacked from the rear, a giant worm will lash out with a bone-like stinger on its tail. It can do this the same round as attempting to swallow.

      Goblins are short (4 tall), evil humanoids that are found in wild forests or mountainous areas. Goblins are tribal and matriarchal. A tribe will normally consist of between 50 and 200 individuals. The leader of the tribe is usually a female of prodigious size and foul temperament.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Goblins are not particularly fearsome opponents in battle unless they are backed by overwhelming numbers or led by a charismatic general. Goblin tribes go through periods of very high birth rates every 5-10 years. This results in periodic invasions of surrounding lands by hordes of goblins on the move due to overpopulation and starvation.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Goblins fear and hate dwarves, since dwarves often enslave them and put them to work in their mines. The average goblin is armed with a wicked-looking serrated short sword and protected by a patchwork of leather armor.

      The hyeena is a horrible beast that resembles a large hound with a spiny ridge running along its back. It lives in tombs or catacombs and feeds on the dead. It will also dig up graves in the search for bodies. Some hyeenas stalk rural areas by night and prey on shepherds or late travelers.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      The hyeena has an unusual magical defense. Any creature that treads on a hyeena's shadow is immediately struck dumb and unable to speak. The effect lasts until the hyeena is killed or an hour has passed.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      The hyeena also has an uncanny talent for imitating the human voice, and uses this trick to lure its prey into an ambush.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Alchemists prize the hyeena's eyes because they can be distilled into small stones that can be used to foretell the future. An alchemist will pay a good fee for a pair of hyeena eyes if they are fresh or have been properly preserved in salt or strong alcohol.

      Imps are small demonic entities, which are either summoned or sent to this plane to aid a sorcerer or priest in some evil scheme. Imps come in many shapes, from man-like to grotesque.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Imps are skilled in Demonic Magic, which works the same way Scholarly Magic does. Demonic Magic excels at magical feats that cause confusion and misery. Most imps have 5 magical power points, and can channel 1- or 2-point spells.

      Medusae are cursed by gods. In ages past, the mother of all medusae compared her own beauty with that of the gods. For this, she and all her descendants were made so hideous, that any who saw them were turned to stone. (Any character who sees a medusa's face must make a Willpower check at a Great Difficulty level, or turn to stone.)
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      A medusa may attempt to take residence in an old villa or abandoned home. There, slowly but surely, a statue garden will begin to grow. The services of a hero may be needed to find a way of killing the poor creature. It has been rumored that when a medusa is slain, her victims return to the flesh.

      Rathent are odd creatures, most likely the result of some magical hybridization gone awry. They resemble humanoid birds, with large, curved beaks and offset eyes. Feathers cover their head, upper torso and arms. Their plumage is generally dark or mottled and unkempt and greasy. Many Rathent have hands ending talon-like claws. Most Rathent have human-like leg structure. Rare individuals will have bird-like legs or vestigial wings, and are generally regarded as gruk (retard or throwback). This is a reflection of cultural bias rather than actual ability or intelligence.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      The structure of Rathent society is loosely tribal with the strongest or most cunning being the skwarka (chieftain). The skwarka leads the tribe in battle and receives the most prestige and breeding privileges.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Rathent are extremely protective of their females, as they have a relatively low birthrate. Only one in five members of a typical Rathent tribe are female.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Rathent males serve as hunters and generally engage in banditry, thievery, and murder to eke out an existence. They are cowardly scavengers by nature and will feed on carrion with glee when there is nothing better.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Most Rathent provide only for themselves, but offer tribute to the skwarka and his harem. Warriors that do not pay tribute regularly to the skwarka are either exiled or more likely killed.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Rathent may be encountered in semi-civilized areas on the outskirts of forests and mountains. Their villages are clusters of rude tree houses similar to nests in structure. The skwarka's nest is the largest and centrally located, and is built into the largest tree available.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Rathent have fair craftsmanship skills, but rarely produce anything of exceptional quality. Most of their weaponry is scavenged or stolen. When left to their own means they will produce javelins, war darts, and spears. Rathent armor is usually cobbled together from bits and pieces scavenged in their raids.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Some Rathent have an innate talent for simple magic. Clerical Magic and Hedge Magic is most common. Scholarly Magic (Elementalism or Necromancy) is also possible, but no Rathent will have more than one level of the Magical Talent: Scholarly Magic Gift. Rathents with Magical Talent are known as kuzkwa. Most are female. All magically talented Rathent are sterile and considered sexless. Many are also albino. These Rathent serve as shamans and spiritual advisors.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Rathent spirituality is a grim affair centered around the malevolent figure Kzukwa-skwark (Old Lord Dread). Homage is paid to this fearsome entity by murdering as many non-Rathent as possible. This ensures that the afterlife will be only moderately painful, rather than an eternity of anguish and torture.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Rathent have an irrational attraction to shiny objects, and will often quarrel over relatively useless objects that glitter.

      Ratlings are small humanoid creatures whose head, claws and tail look like those of a rat. Their legs are also more ratlike than human. Ratlings have a low life expectancy due to disease resulting from poor living conditions. Ratlings can speak as well as humans, and usually speak the local dominant language. Their claws are dexterous enough to allow a Ratling to use equipment made for humans.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Ratlings were created by a Grand Mage who later allowed his experiments to leave his laboratory. In the few years since their creation, the Ratlings have established themselves amid the slums and backways of the city.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      The GM may involve Ratlings in the city's political scene if desired. Examples: The local ruler has placed a bounty on Ratling skins; Ratlings are active in the Thieves' or Beggars' Guilds; etc.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      The GM may adjust Ratlings to be smaller and more ratlike, if she likes. Suggested Scale: -5 or less (remember to adjust Offensive and Defensive Damage Factors).

      Time and time again, necromancers turn to dead humanoids when trying to inexpensively create tireless, fearless guardians. Corpses are versatile, readily available, and the once-living bones lend themselves well to enchantment. A lesser nether-spirit is bound to the dead bones, animating them and providing a rudimentary, malevolent intelligence. The resulting creatures need no sustenance, are infinitely patient, and obey the commands of their creators without question. They are often set to guard tombs, fortresses, and hiding places of all sorts.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      The Restless Dead appear as piles of old bones scattered around the places they guard. They have no odor (prior to enchantment, the corpses are usually stripped of all flesh by being placed onto anthills or in maggot pits). It takes a Perception roll of Great or above to detect the thin webwork of sigils covering the bones from any distance.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      When anyone or anything comes near, the bones reassemble into malevolent, skeletal forms and spring into action.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Though not terribly strong, the Restless Dead are agile and tenacious. They are often equipped with rusty, patchwork armor (+1), shields (+1), and various weapons such as maces, swords, axes, and spears (+1 to +3).

      The wall crawler resembles nothing so much as a nightmarish cross between a giant centipede and a black, furry caterpillar. A wall crawler is usually 1 to 1 6 long and, except for its head, is completely covered with 6 long black spines. The crawler skitters along on sixteen feet that are equipped with an array of tiny hook-like protrusions. These allow the creature to travel over almost any surface. It can traverse a cave ceiling or dungeon wall as easily as it does the ground.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Wall crawlers are found in dark places and fill the role of scavengers, devouring the dead and sometimes the dying. Wall crawlers rarely attack living creatures unless in defense or if the creature is badly injured. They are usually encountered in groups of 7-12 individuals.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      In combat, a wall crawler can deliver a painful bite that sometimes becomes infected. Its real danger, however, lies in the spines that cover its body. These spines are sharp and can easily pierce cloth or the leather sole of a boot. The hollow spines contain a toxin that causes confusion and hallucinations. If an adventurer contacts a spine, he must make a Fair difficulty Health Roll. If he fails the roll, he will become confused and disoriented within minutes. For the next 2-4 hours he will be effectively incapacitated by hallucinations, unable to fight or find his way without assistance.

      Zombies are walking corpses, with shreds of flesh still attached. They are animated through evil magics (Necromancy, Sorcery, or some evil Clerical Magic) and obey the instructions of their creators. Zombies continue to decay, giving them a vile stench and a horrifying appearance. They may also be disease carriers. The GM may require characters exposed to zombies to make a Health Roll (Difficulty Level Mediocre) to avoid contracting some suitably noxious disease.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Zombies have no initiative, relying on their master for instructions. Feeling no fear or pain, they make excellent shock troops. They are almost indestructible, requiring a Near Death result to "kill" them.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Zombies are unable to wield weapons. They attack with their hands and nails, pummeling their opponents with mindless intensity. They will attempt to surround and overwhelm difficult opponents.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Zombies are unintelligent (mindless), and so have no speech, skills, etc., although they may moan while attacking. They may be repelled with the Repel Undead Clerical Magic skill (Difficulty Level Mediocre).
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Zombies usually inhabit cemeteries, abandoned churches, necromancers' strongholds, or temples to evil gods.

      An evil priest, sorcerer, or necromancer can create a Zuvembie by draining the life force from a man-sized humanoid creature via arcane magics and poisons. A Zuvembie's flesh becomes hard and its skin leathery as a result of the process, and Zuvembie bodies do not show the decay of true zombies. They retain some intelligence, unlike zombies, and can understand relatively complex instructions. They wield weapons (albeit clumsily), and may retain some of the skills they maintained in life, but reduced by 2 levels.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      As with zombies, Zuvembies are immune to pain and require a Near Death result to "kill" them.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Zuvembies usually inhabit their creators' residence. They may be Repelled with Great difficulty.
