    <meta content="Fudge is a generic role-playing game system for use in freeform role-playing games. The name &quot;FUDGE&quot; was once an acronym for Freeform Universal Donated (later, Do-it-yourself) Gaming Engine and, though the acronym has since been dropped, that phrase remains a good summation of the game's design goals. Fudge has been nominated for an Origins Award for Best Role-Playing Game System for the Deryni Role-Playing Game. Rather than being a rigidly pre-defined set of rules like d20 System or GURPS, Fudge offers a customizable toolkit for building the users' own specialized role-playing game system. Such things as what attributes and skills will define characters are left to be determined by the Game Master and players, and several different optional systems for resolving actions and conflicts are offered. Fudge is not tied to any particular genre or setting and world builders are encouraged to invent appropriate attributes and rules tailored to the campaign." name="description">

      <span class="c6">Fudge was originally written 1992-1995 by Steffan O'Sullivan with help and feedback from many gamers on the Usenet newsgroup rec.games.design. It was published online in 1993 with a "Legal Notice" allowing for free distribution and creation of derivative works under a limited, royalty-free license. (As far as we're aware, Fudge was the first roleplaying game system to be published under an "open content" license.)</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      In 1994, Ann Dupuis, doing business as "Wild Mule Games," published the first Fudge book under a commercial publishing license from Steffan O'Sullivan. The "Wild Mule" Fudge book contained the 1993 version of the rules. In July 1995, Grey Ghost Press, Inc. (Wild Mule Games' successor) published the first widely distributed Fudge book, containing the June 1995 version of the rules (the version that Steffan was satisfied enough with to stop tinkering).
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Six years later, Grey Ghost Press published a new Fudge book - the Expanded Edition. The Expanded Edition had everything from the 1995 edition, plus additional material including Fantasy Fudge, a pre-customized version of Fudge for use in a fantasy setting. This Fudge System Reference Document contains the text from the 2000 Fudge Expanded Edition.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Now in 2005, in celebration of the company's 10th anniversary, Grey Ghost Press is releasing a hardcover edition of Fudge. In addition to most of the material in the Expanded Edition (and in this Fudge System Reference Document), the 10th Anniversary edition of Fudge has extensive lists of gifts, faults, skills, and attributes, alternative rules, advice on "fudging" Fudge games, and more - more than twice as much material as in the Expanded Edition. Much of that new material will also be released under the Open Game License (although not as part of the core Fudge System Reference Document).

    </p>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Fudge is a rules-light roleplaying game (RPG), concentrating on role-playing rather than endless dice rolls and tables and similar detailed game mechanics. It also uses words rather than numbers to describe character traits. For example, a character might be a Great swordsman rather than a "14th level fighter." Combined with simple action resolution, Fudge's descriptive nature makes ideal it for novice players. Fudge is also flexible enough to satisfy experienced role-players. There are no artificial limits placed on character creation; any character the player can imagine can be described in Fudge terms. (The GM has final say over whether or not a character is acceptable in a given game.)
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The basic Fudge rules contain no campaign world information (except for a few examples). But the game's flexibility allows it to be easily used with nearly any other role-playing game's campaign world - and, of course, with Gamemasters' own personal creations.

    </p>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">No Fixed Attributes</span>. The GM chooses attributes that match the genre played and suit individual taste. A GM designing a simple Fudge game may choose only two attributes (Body and Mind, for instance), or may dispense with attributes entirely and have a character's abilities entirely defined by skills, gifts, and faults. Another Gamemaster may choose 6 attributes, or 10, or more. There are a lot of attributes to choose from.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Skill-driven system</span>. The GM selects the skills, whether they are broadly defined skill groups or finely defined individual skills. You can even mix broad definitions with narrow ones without any loss of playability.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Simple action resolution</span>. Players use normal six-sided dice - or, optionally, special Fudge dice- to determine how well their characters perform any action. Results describe degrees of success (or failure!) in words - from Superb down to Terrible. Alternative dice methods allow for 20-sided or percentile dice to be used.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Painless translation</span>. The word-based system lets you easily translate any campaign world or adventure written in Fudge into any other system - and vice versa! Fudge thus works as a "universal translator" of gaming systems.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Design your own</span>. If you are thinking of designing your own home rules role-playing game, simply reading Fudge can provide an excellent introduction to everything you need consider as a game designer!
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Goodies Galore</span>. The Fudge game was first published on the Internet, and alternative rules and supplementary materials are freely available at various on-line sites. The Grey Ghost Games website includes links to many of these Fudge-related sites. There is also an active Fudge e-mail list.

      Although Fudge is designed to be customized by each Gamemaster, there are some game design decisions at the core of Fudge that are used by most Fudge Gamemasters.

    </p>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Fudge characters are described by "traits," including attributes (any trait that everyone in the game world has), skills (any trait that isn't an attribute and can be improved through practice), gifts (any trait that isn't an attribute or skill but is something positive for the character), and faults (any trait that limits a character's actions or earns him a bad reaction from other people). Supernormal powers are treated as potent gifts.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Fudge uses ordinary words to describe some traits, especially attributes and skills. The following terms of a seven-level sequence are the words suggested by the Fudge author and used in Grey Ghost Games products:

      Fudge provides two basic means of creating characters: the "subjective" and "objective" systems.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      In the subjective system, the player and GM work together to describe the character in Fudge terms, building from a strong character concept.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      In the objective system, a character's traits start at a default level (Fair for attributes; Poor for most skills) and the GM grants each player a number of "free" levels to allocate. She may also grant "free" gifts, or require one or more faults. The player can then spend two free levels to raise an attribute from Fair to Great, for instance; or sacrifice a number of levels to gain a gift, or give his character a fault in return for levels to apply somewhere else.

    </p>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Some characters or creatures have certain attributes that are way beyond the human norm. Prime examples include Strength, Mass, and Speed. Such attributes are rated in Scale, which acts as a modifier in interactions between creatures or items of different Scale.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      In a human-based game, Human Scale is 0. A race of greater-than-human average strength would be Scale +1 Strength or more, while a race of lesser average strength would be Scale -1 Strength or less. Individuals are then of Fair or Good Strength, etc., relative to those of their own Scale.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      In a "Bunnies" game, where the player characters are rabbits, Rabbit Scale would be 0, while Human Scale would likely be +7. In a "Mecha" game, where the player characters were giant robots, Mecha Scale would be 0, while Human Scale would depend on the actual size difference between the Mechs and humans; a Human Scale of -15 relative to the Mecha Scale of 0 would not be unreasonable.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      To calculate appropriate Strength/Mass Scale values, figure that each level of Strength Scale represents an increase of about 1.5 times the Strength and Mass of the previous Scale level. This is because the Fudge core rules define each level of Strength (from Terrible to Superb) to be 1.5 times stronger than the previous level. (This progression isn't necessarily true for other attributes. Superb Dexterity is only about twice as good as Fair Dexterity, and each level of Speed is 1.2 times faster than the previous level.) Strength Scale increases at the same rate: a Scale 1, Fair Strength individual is 1.5 times stronger than a Scale 0, Fair Strength individual.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Note that Scale 1 Fair Strength is not exactly equal to a Scale 0 Good Strength - Scale really measures Mass, or Density, and affects how easily a creature may be hurt. A Scale 1 Fair Strength fighter has an advantage over a Scale 0 Good Strength fighter, even though their Strengths are equal. The Scale 1 fighter is less affected by the other's damage due to his greater mass.

    </p>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      For any action the player character wishes to perform, the GM must determine which trait is tested. (This will usually be a skill or an attribute.) If the action is Unopposed, the GM determines the Difficulty Level. Some actions are so easy that the character succeeds automatically; others are impossible (no rolls needed).

    </p>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      When a character performs an action that isn't influenced by anyone else, it is referred to as an Unopposed action. Examples include jumping a wide chasm, climbing a cliff, etc.

      <span class="Emphasis">Rolled Degree</span><span class="c6">: This refers to how well a character does at a particular task. If someone is Good at Climbing in general, but the die-roll shows a +1 to the character's skill, then the rolled degree is one level higher than the character's skill level - Great, in this case. Rolled degrees from Superb +1 to Superb +4 are possible; a GM may thus set a Difficulty Level beyond Superb for nearly impossible actions. Likewise, there are rolled degrees from Terrible -1 down to Terrible -4. The GM should use her imagination in determining the consequences of such abysmal failures.</span>

    </p>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Actions are Opposed when other people (or animals, etc.) may have an effect on the outcome of the action. In this case, the player of each contestant rolls some dice, and the results are compared to determine the outcome.

The relative degree is expressed as a number of levels. If a PC gets a rolled degree result of Good in a fight, and his NPC foe gets a rolled degree result of Mediocre, the PC beat his foe by two levels - the relative degree is +2 from his perspective, -2 from hers.</span>

      Fudge dice are six-sided dice with two sides marked + (+1), two sides marked - (-1), and two sides left blank (+/-0). Rolling four Fudge dice (4dF) gives results from -4 (sub-Terrible) to +4 (trans-Superb). To determine the result of an action, roll the dice; use the result to modify the trait level being tested. For example, a +3 dice result added to a Fair trait is a Superb rolled degree; a -1 result added to a Fair trait indicates a Mediocre result.

    <p class="DefinitionTerm c7">
      Trait:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionDefinition c7">
      anything that describes a character. A trait can be an attribute, skill, inherited gift, fault, supernormal power, or any other feature that describes a character. The GM is the ultimate authority on what is an attribute and what is a skill, gift, etc.
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionTerm c7">
      Level:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionDefinition c7">
      most traits are described by one of seven adjectives. These seven descriptive words represent levels a trait may be at. In addition, the Objective Character Creation method grants the player free levels, and demands he keep track of them. In this case, one level is required to raise a trait to the next better adjective.
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionTerm c7">
      Attribute:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionDefinition">
      <span class="c6">any trait that everyone in the game world has, in some degree or other. See Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secattributes"><span class="Internetlink">1.3.1</span></a><span class="c6">, Attributes, for a sample list of attributes. On a scale of Terrible…Fair… Superb, the average human will have an attribute at Fair.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionTerm c7">
      Skill:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionDefinition c7">
      any trait that isn't an attribute, but can be improved through practice. The default for an unlisted skill is usually Poor, though that can vary up or down a little.
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionTerm c7">
      Gift:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionDefinition c7">
      any trait that isn't an attribute or skill, but is something positive for the character. Some GMs will define a certain trait as a gift, while others will define the same trait as an attribute. In general, if the trait doesn't easily fit the Terrible…Fair…Superb scale, it's probably a gift.
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionTerm c7">
      Fault:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionDefinition c7">
      any trait that limits a character's actions, or earns him a bad reaction from other people.

        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      These levels should be written on each character sheet for easy reference.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      A GM may alter this list in any way she desires, including expanding or shrinking it. For example, if Superb doesn't sound right to you, use Awesome - or even Way Cool. If the words Mediocre and Fair don't make sense to you, change them. These seven terms will be used in the rules, however, for clarity.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      To remember the order, compare adjacent words. If, as a beginner, your eventual goal is to become an excellent game player, for example, ask yourself if you'd rather be called a Fair game player or a Mediocre game player.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      There is an additional level that can be used in Fudge, but is not listed above: Legendary, which is beyond Superb. Those with Legendary Strength, for example, are in the 99.9th percentile, and their names can be found in any book of world records.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Important Note</span><span class="c6">: not every GM will allow PCs to become Legendary. Even in games that do include the Legendary level, it is not recommended that any character be allowed to start the game as Legendary. Superb represents the 98th to 99.9th percentile of any given trait, which should be enough for any beginning PC. Of course, if a player character gets a bit overconfident, meeting an NPC Legendary swordswoman can be a grounding experience?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      If someone really has to begin play as a Legendary swordsman, strong man, etc., doing the GM's laundry for half a year or so (in advance) should be a sufficient bribe to be allowed to start at that level. Of course, working towards Legendary makes a great campaign goal, and so PCs may rise to that height, given enough playing time and a generous GM.

      Most games combine many of these attributes, while others treat some of them as gifts or even skills. In Fudge, if you wish, you can even split these attributes into smaller ones: Lifting Strength, Carrying Strength, Damage-dealing Strength, etc.

    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Skills are not related to attributes or their levels in Fudge. Players are encouraged to design their characters logically - a character with a lot of Good physical skills should probably have better than average physical attributes, for example. On the other hand, Fudge allows a player to create someone like Groo the Wanderer<span class="Footnoteanchor"><a target="_self" href="#ftn1" id="bodyftn1" name="bodyftn1">1</a></span>, who is very clumsy yet extremely skilled with his swords.

    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The GM should then decide what level of skill depth she wants. Are skills broad categories such as "Social skills," or moderately broad abilities, such as "Inspire People, Parley, and Market Savvy," or are they specific abilities such as "Barter, Seduce, Repartee, Persuade, Fast-Talk, Bully, Grovel, Carouse, Flatter, Bribe," etc.?

      An attribute is, in some ways, a very broad skill group, and skills may be ignored altogether if desired.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Combat skills require special consideration. The broadest possible category is simply that: Combat Skills. A broad range breaks that down to Melee Weapons, Unarmed Combat, and Missile Weapons. A somewhat narrower approach would break down Melee Weapons into Close Combat Melee Weapons (knives, blackjacks, etc.), One-handed Melee Weapons (one-handed swords, axes, maces, etc.) and Two-handed Melee Weapons (polearms, spears, battle-axes, two-handed swords, etc.). Or, for a precise list of skills, each group in parentheses could be listed as a separate skill; a character skilled at using a broadsword knows nothing about using a saber, for example.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Each choice has its merits. Broad skill groups that include many sub-skills make for an easy character sheet and fairly competent characters, while specific skills allow fine-tuning a character to a precise degree.

    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      A gift is a positive trait that doesn't seem to fit the Terrible… Fair…Superb scale that attributes and skills fall into. However, this will vary from GM to GM: a photographic memory is a gift to one GM, while it is a Superb Memory attribute to another. Some GMs will define Charisma as an attribute, while others define it as a gift. To one Gamemaster, a character either has Night Vision or he doesn't; another will allow characters to take different levels of it. A Gamemaster may not even have gifts in her game at all.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Alternatively, gifts can come in levels, but the levels don't necessarily coincide with the levels used by other traits. For example, Status might be three- or four-tiered, or even nine-tiered instead of fitting into the seven levels of attributes and skills. Wealth might come only in five different levels - whatever each GM desires.

Likewise, traits above the human norm, such as a super strong fantasy or alien race, are treated by definition as supernormal powers.</span>

      Faults are anything that makes life more difficult for a character. The primary faults are those that restrict a character's actions or earn him a bad reaction from chance-met NPCs. Various attitudes, neuroses and phobias are faults; so are physical disabilities and social stigmas. There are heroic faults, too: a code of honor and inability to tell a lie restrict your actions significantly, but are not signs of flawed personality.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      A character's personality may be represented by one or more traits, or it can be written out as character background or description.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      As an example of the first case, courage is an attribute, a gift, or even a fault. As an attribute, Superb Courage or Terrible Courage has an obvious meaning. As a gift, obvious bravery gives the character a positive reaction from people he meets (assuming they see him being courageous, or have heard of his deeds, of course).
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      However, both Very Courageous and Very Cowardly can be faults because they can limit a character's actions. A courageous character might not run away from a fight even if it were in his best interest, while a cowardly one would have a hard time staying in a fight even if he stood to gain by staying.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Or a character's level of courage might not be a quantified trait at all, but something the player simply decides. "Moose is very brave," a player jots down, and that is that. It doesn't have to count as a high attribute, gift, or fault.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      A player should ask the GM how she wants to handle specific personality traits. If the player describes his character in detail, the GM can easily decide which personality traits are attributes, gifts, or faults. However they are handled, most characters benefit by having their personalities fleshed out.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Fudge Points are meta-game gifts that may be used to buy "luck" during a game - they let the players fudge a game result. These are "meta-game" gifts because they operate at the player-GM level, not character-character level. Not every GM will allow Fudge Points - those who prefer realistic games should probably not use them.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The GM sets the starting number of Fudge Points. The recommended range is from one to five. Unused Fudge Points are saved up for the next gaming session. Each player may get an additional number each gaming session. (This is also set by the GM, and may or may not equal the starting level.) Alternately, the GM may simply allow Experience Points (EP) to be traded for Fudge Points at a rate appropriate for the campaign: 3 EP = 1 Fudge Point, down to 1 EP = 1 Fudge Point.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Fudge Points can be used in many ways, depending on what level on the realistic-legendary scale the game is played at. Here are some suggested ways to use them - the GM can create her own uses, of course. A GM may allow as few or many of these options as she wishes - the players should ask her before assuming they can do something with Fudge Points.
    </p>
    <ol class="c88">
      <li>
        <p class="MyList c87">
          Spending a Fudge Point may accomplish an Unopposed action automatically and with panache - good for impressing members of the appropriate sex, and possibly avoiding injury in the case of dangerous actions. The GM may veto this use of Fudge Points for actions with a Difficulty Level of Beyond Superb. The GM may disallow this option for an Opposed action, such as combat.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="MyList c87">
          A player may spend one Fudge Point to alter a die roll one level, up or down as desired. The die roll can be either one the player makes, or one the GM makes that directly concerns the player's character.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="MyList c87">
          A player may spend one Fudge Point to declare that wounds aren't as bad as they first looked. This reduces the intensity of each wound by one or two levels (a Hurt result becomes a Scratch, for example, or even a Very Hurt becomes a Scratch). Or it can mean that any one wound (or more), regardless of level, is just a Scratch. This latter option may cost more than one Fudge point. The GM can restrict this to outside of combat time.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="MyList c87">
          A player may spend one (or more) Fudge Points to get an automatic +4 result, without having to roll the dice. This use is available in Opposed actions, if allowed.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="MyList c87">
          For appropriately legendary games, a GM-set number of Fudge Points can be spent to ensure a favorable coincidence. (This is always subject to GM veto, of course.) For example, if the PCs are in a maximum security prison, perhaps one of the guards turns out to be the cousin of one of the PCs - and lets them escape! Or the captain of the fishing boat rescuing the PCs turns out to be someone who owes a favor to one of them, and is willing to take them out of his way to help them out? And so on. This option should cost a lot of Fudge Points, except in certain genres where bizarre coincidences are the norm.

The GM may even make a template, if desired - a collection of traits she deems important (with room for customization) - and let the players define the level of each trait. See Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#sectemplates"><span class="Internetlink">6.1.2</span></a><span class="c6">, Templates.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      When a character is created, the player should define as many character traits as he finds necessary - which may or may not coincide with a GM-determined list. If a player adds an attribute the GM deems unnecessary, the GM may treat that attribute as simply a description of the character. She may require a roll against a different attribute than the player has in mind, and the player must abide by her decision.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      As an example, a certain GM decides she wants characters to have a general Dexterity attribute. A player takes Good Dexterity for his PC, but wants to show that the character is better at whole body dexterity than at manual dexterity. So he writes: Great Agility and Fair Manual Dexterity. However, the GM can ignore these distinctions, and simply require a Dexterity roll, since that is the trait she has chosen. (She can average the PC-chosen levels, or simply select one of them.) Of course, she can also allow him to roll on the attributes he has created.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      In Fudge, a character with a trait at Fair will succeed at ordinary tasks 62% of the time - there is usually no need to create a superstar. In fact, Great is just that: great! Superb should be reserved for the occasional trait in which your character is the best he's ever met.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Any trait that is not defined at character creation will be at a default level:
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="Emphasis">For attributes</span>: Fair.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="Emphasis">For most skills</span>: Poor (easier skills are at Mediocre, while harder ones are at Terrible). A skill default means untrained, or close to it. However, it is possible to take a skill at Terrible (below the default level for most skills), which implies an ineptitude worse than untrained.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="Emphasis">For most gifts, supernormal powers and certain GM-defined skills</span>: Non-Existent. (That is, the default is non-existent. The trait itself exists in some character, somewhere.)
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Each player should expect the GM to modify his character after creation - it's the nature of the game. The GM should expect to review each character before play. It would, in fact, be best if the characters were made in the presence of the GM so she can answer questions during the process.

      <span class="c6">An easy way to create a character in Fudge is simply to write down everything about the character that you feel is important. Any attribute or skill should be rated using one of the levels Terrible through Superb (see Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#sectraitlevels"><span class="Internetlink">1.2</span></a><span class="c6">, Fudge Trait Levels).</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">It may be easiest, though, if the GM supplies a template of attributes she'll be using. See Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#seccharexamples"><span class="Internetlink">6.3</span></a><span class="c6">, Character Examples, for template ideas.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The GM may also tell the player in advance that his character can be Superb in a certain number of attributes, Great in so many others, and Good in yet another group. For example, in an epic-style game with eight attributes, the GM allows one Superb attribute, two Greats, and three Goods. In a more realistic game, this is one Superb, one Great, and two Goods.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      This can apply to skills, too: one Superb skill, two Great skills, and six Good skills is a respectable number for a realistic campaign, while two Superbs, three Greats, and ten Goods is quite generous, even in a highly cinematic game.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The GM may also simply limit the number of skills a character can take at character creation: 10, 15, or 20 are possible choices.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Gifts and faults can be restricted this way, also. For example, a GM allows a character to have two gifts, but he must take at least three faults. Taking another fault allows another gift, or another skill at Great, and so on.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      These limitations help the player define the focus of the character a bit better: what is his best trait (what can he do best)?
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      A simple "two lower for one higher" trait-conversion mechanic can also be used. If the GM allows one Superb attribute, for example, the player may forego that and take two attributes at Great, instead. The converse may also be allowed: a player may swap two skills at Good to get one at Great.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Example</span>: a player wants a Jack-of-all-trades character, and the GM has limits of one Superb skill, two Great skills and six Good skills. The player trades the one Superb skill limit for two Great skills: he can now take four skills at Great. However, he trades all four Great skills in order to have eight more Good skills. His character can now have 14 skills at Good, but none at any higher levels.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      In the Subjective Character Creation system, it is easy to use both broad and narrow skill groups, as appropriate for the character. In these cases, a broad skill group is assumed to contain the phrase, "except as listed otherwise."
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      For example, a player wishes to play the science officer of a starship. He decides this character has spent so much time studying the sciences, that he's weak in most physical skills. So on his character sheet he could simply write:
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      Physical Skills: Poor
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      He also decides that his character's profession would take him out of the ship in vacuum quite a bit, to examine things. So he'd have to be somewhat skilled at zero-G maneuvering. So he then adds:
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      Zero-G Maneuvering: Good
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Even though this is a physical skill, it is not at Poor because he specifically listed it as an exception to the broad category.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">When the character write-up is done, the player and GM meet and discuss the character. If the GM feels the character is too potent for the campaign she has in mind, she may ask the player to reduce the character's power - see Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secminimizingabuse"><span class="Internetlink">1.9</span></a><span class="c6">, Minimizing Abuse.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The GM may also need to suggest areas that she sees as being too weak - perhaps she has a game situation in mind that will test a trait the player didn't think of. Gentle hints, such as "Does he have any social skills?" can help the player through the weak spots. Of course, if there are multiple players, other PCs can compensate for an individual PC's weaknesses. In this case, the question to the whole group is then, "Does anyone have any social skills?"
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Instead of the player writing up the character in terms of traits and levels, he can simply write out a prose description of his character. This requires the GM to translate everything into traits and appropriate levels, but that's not hard to do if the description is well written. This method actually produces some of the best characters.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">An example</span>:
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      GM: "I see you rate Captain Wallop's blaster skill highly, and also his piloting and gunnery, but I'm only allowing one Superb skill - which is he best at?"
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      Player: "Blaster!"
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      GM: "Okay, Superb Blaster. That would then be Great Piloting and Great Gunnery, all right? That leaves you with two more skills to be at Great, since I allow four to start out. Hmmm - I notice he successfully penetrated the main Khothi hive and rescued the kidnapped ambassador - that sounds like a Great Ability to Move Quietly to me - is that accurate, or would you describe it as some other ability?"
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      Player: "Uh, no - sorry, I didn't write that clearly enough. He disguised himself and pretended to be a Khothi worker!"
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      GM: "Ah, I see! How about Great Disguise skill and Great Acting ability, then? And he must be Good at the Khothi language, right?"
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      And so on.

      For those who don't mind counting numbers a bit, the following method creates interesting and well-balanced characters.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      In this system, all traits start at default level. The GM then allows a number of free levels the players may use to raise selected traits to higher levels. Players may then lower certain traits in order to raise others even further. Finally, a player may opt to trade some levels of one trait type (such as attributes) for another (skills, for example). The whole process insures that no single character will dominate every aspect of play.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      A GM using the Objective Character Creation system should decide how many attributes she deems necessary in the campaign. She can choose to leave it up to each player, if she wishes. Players then have a number of free attribute levels equal to half the number of attributes (round up). For example, if she selects four attributes, each player starts with two free levels he can use to raise his character's attributes.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      For a more high-powered game, the GM may allow a number of free levels equal to the number of attributes chosen.

      All attributes are considered to be Fair until the player raises or lowers them. The cost of raising or lowering an attribute is:

      Thus, a player may raise his Strength attribute (which is Fair by default) to Good by spending one free attribute level. He could then spend another free level to raise Strength again to Great. This would exhaust his free levels if there were only four attributes - but he would have one more if there were six attributes, and eight more free levels if there were 20 attributes.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">When the free attribute levels have been exhausted, an attribute can be raised further by lowering another attribute an equal amount. (See also Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#sectradingtraits"><span class="Internetlink">1.6.4</span></a><span class="c6">, Trading Traits.) From the previous example, Strength can be raised one more level (to Superb) if the player lowers the character's Charm to Mediocre to compensate for the increase in Strength.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      If the GM allows the players to choose their own attributes, she may simply tell them to take half as many free levels as attributes they choose. If a player chooses an attribute and leaves it at Fair, that attribute does not count towards the total of attributes which determines the amount of free levels. That is, a player cannot simply add twelve attributes, all at Fair, in order to get six more free levels to raise the others with. GM-mandated attributes left at Fair do count when determining the number of free levels, though.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      As an interesting possibility for those who want attributes and skills to reflect each other accurately, do not let the players adjust attribute levels at all. Instead, they select only skill levels, gifts and faults for their characters. When the character is done, the GM can then determine what attribute levels make sense for the skill levels chosen, and discuss it with the player.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Example</span>: a character is made with many combat and wilderness skills, but no social skills. He also has a smattering of intelligence skills. The GM decides that this character has Strength, Dexterity and Health of Great from spending a lot of time outdoors, practicing with weapons, etc. She will even let the player choose one to be at Superb, if desired. Perception is probably Good, since wilderness survival depends on it. Any social attribute is Mediocre at best - possibly even Poor - while Intelligence is Mediocre or Fair. If the player objects to the low Intelligence ranking, the GM can point out that the character hasn't spent much time in skills that hone Intelligence, and if he wants his character's IQ to be higher, he should adjust his skill list.

      Certain skills have a default of non-existent. These would include Languages, Karate, Nuclear Physics, or Knowledge of Aztec Rituals, which must be studied to be known at all. When a character studies such a skill (puts a level into it at character creation, or experience points later in the game), the level he gets it at depends on how hard it is to learn. Putting one level into learning the Spanish language, for example, would get it at Mediocre, since it's of average difficulty to learn. Nuclear Physics, on the other hand, might only be Poor or even Terrible with only one level put into it. It would take four levels just to get such a skill at Fair, for example.

      <span class="c6">As in the Subjective Character Creation system, the GM may limit the number of Superb and Great skills each character may have at character creation. For a highly cinematic or super-powered game, no limit is necessary. For example, the GM sets a limit of one Superb skill, three or four Great skills, and eight or so Good skills. These limits can be exceeded through character development, of course. See Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#seccharexamples"><span class="Internetlink">6.3</span></a><span class="c6">, Character Examples.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">Once the free levels are used up, a skill must be dropped one level (from the default Poor to Terrible) to raise another skill one level. (See also Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#sectradingtraits"><span class="Internetlink">1.6.4</span></a><span class="c6">, Trading Traits.) All choices are subject to GM veto, of course.</span>

    <p class="Textbody c7">
      It is possible to mix different breadths of skill groupings. A GM who has little interest in combat can simply choose Unarmed Combat, Melee Weapons and Ranged Weapons as the only three combat skills. But this does not stop her from using all the individual Social skills (and many more) listed as examples on page. If this option is chosen, the broad groups cost double the levels of the narrower groups.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Mixing skill group sizes within the same areas is awkward in the Objective Character Creation system. For example, it is difficult to have a generic Thief Skills group and also have individual skills of lockpicking, pick-pocketing, palming, security-device dismantling, etc. If she does wish to do this, then the broad skill group in this case has a maximum limit of Good, and triple cost to raise - or more, if the GM so mandates.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      If the GM is using broad groups, a player may raise a specific skill (such as Poker, for example, instead of general Gambling skill). A player would give his character a specific skill when the GM is using broad-based skill groups to fit a character concept. Do not expect the character to be equally adept with the other skills in the group. This would be true for Groo<span class="c102"><a target="_self" href="#ftn1">1</a></span> the Wanderer, for instance, who would simply raise Sword skill, even if the GM is using the broad term Melee Weapons as a skill group. Groo would have, in fact, a Poor rating with all other Melee weapons, and this would accurately reflect the character.

      Whether the character is created subjectively or objectively, each character has some free uncommitted traits (perhaps two or three). At some point in the game, a player will realize that he forgot something about the character that should have been mentioned.

      GM-set skill limits (such as one Superb, three Greats) are still in effect: if the character already has the maximum number of Superb skills allowed, he can't make an uncommitted trait a Superb skill.

    </h2>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Obviously, character creation in Fudge can be abused. There are many ways to avoid this:
    </p>
    <ol class="c88">
      <li>
        <p class="MyList c87">
          The GM can require that the character take another fault or two to balance the power. ("Okay, I'll allow you to have all that? but you need a challenge. Take on another weakness: maybe some secret vice, or be unable to tell a believable lie, or anything that fits the character concept that I can use to test you now and then.")
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="MyList c87">
          She can simply veto any trait (or raised/lowered combination) she feels is abusive. ("I see you raised Battle-Axe in exchange for lowering Needlepoint. Hmmm.") This allows the GM to customize the power level of a game. For high-powered games, allow most anything; for less cinematic campaigns, make them trade equally useful trait for trait.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="MyList c87">
          She can simply note the character weaknesses and introduce a situation into every adventure where at least one of them is significant to the mission. ("You'll be sent as an emissary to the Wanduzi tribe - they value fine Needlepoint work above all other skills, by the way…")
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="MyList c87">
          She can use the "disturbance in the force" technique of making sure that more powerful characters attract more serious problems. ("The bruiser enters the bar with a maniacal look in his eye. He scans the room for a few seconds, then begins to stare intently at you.")

    </h2>
    <p class="DefinitionTerm c7">
      Supernormal power:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionDefinition c7">
      that which is beyond the capability of human beings as we know them. Supernormal powers are treated as powerful gifts. Some may have associated skills (which are taken separately, using the normal skill rules).
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionTerm c7">
      Power:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionDefinition c7">
      a supernormal power.
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionTerm c7">
      Mana:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionDefinition c7">
      magical energy. Mana is an invisible substance that magicians can detect (or even create) and manipulate to alter matter, time and space.
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionTerm c7">
      Magic:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionDefinition c7">
      the art of influencing events through manipulation of mana, or through compelling beings from another dimension, or channeling power from some other source. Magic may be studied by humans, but it is inherent in some races, such as natives of Faerie.
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionTerm c7">
      Miracle:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionDefinition c7">
      magic performed by a deity. Miracles are often subtle. Holy persons can attempt to work miracles by invoking their deity. Some religions call any non- or semi-material being greater than human a deity. Others believe there is only one Deity, and that these other beings are simply angels, demons, djinni, efriti, etc. In the former belief, magical results wrought by these superhuman beings are miracles; in the latter belief, they are not miracles, but merely a display of more psychic power than humans are capable of.
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionTerm c7">
      Psi:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionDefinition c7">
      any power that involves mind over matter, time or space.
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionTerm c7">
      Superpower:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionDefinition c7">
      any supernormal power that is an inherent ability, whether because of mutation, exposure to radiation, a gift of space aliens, etc., or granted by a device, such as an alien-science belt. Examples of superpowers can be found in many comic books, and include super strength, the ability to fly, see through walls, cling to ceilings, become invisible, etc.
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionTerm c7">
      Cybernetic Enhancement:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionDefinition c7">
      any mechanical or electronic enhancement to a normal body that gives the character supernormal powers.
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionTerm c7">
      Non-human Races:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionDefinition c7">
      certain fantasy and science fiction races (actually species) have abilities beyond the human norm, such as being much stronger, or able to fly, etc. Most of these abilities could also be classified as Psi or Superpowers, so they are not treated separately, except for Mass and Strength. Androids and robots are considered races for rules purposes.
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionTerm c7">
      Scale:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionDefinition c7">
      characters may have certain attributes that are well beyond the human norm, one way or the other, but that need to be related to the human norm. Prime examples include Strength, Mass, and Speed. Such attributes are rated in Scale. Human Scale is 0. A race (or individual) of greater than human average strength, for example, would be Scale 1 Strength or more, while a race of lesser average strength than humans would be Scale -1 Strength or less. Individuals can then be of Fair strength, or Good strength, etc., relative to those of their own Scale.
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionTerm c7">
      Genetic Enhancement:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionDefinition c7">
      a genetic enhancement may or may not give a character supernormal powers. If it does, then it must be treated like any other supernormal power listed above.

    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The best way to design a supernormal character is through close discussion with the GM. A player should describe what he wants the character to be able to do, and the GM will decide if that's within the limits she has in mind for the game. If not, she'll make suggestions about how to change the character to fit her campaign.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Supernormal powers are treated as powerful gifts, with availability set by the GM. The GM may decide that each player can take two Powers for free, for example, or five, or more. The player may make a case for further Powers, but may need to take faults to balance them.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Some Powers are so effective that they are worth more than other Powers. In the Objective Character Creation system, the GM may set the cost of a certain supernormal power equal to two or three "average" supernormal powers. In some cases, the GM may veto player suggestions outright: omniscience and omnipotence are good examples!
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The GM may decide that supernormal powers may be pooled with other traits for trading purposes. In this case, one average Power is worth two gifts. For example, a player who wishes to play a magician in a fantasy setting will need to trade some skill, attribute, or gift levels to buy magical Powers.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Undefined Powers have a default of non-existent - that is, they do not have a default value of Fair, like attributes, or Poor, like skills. If a supernormal power is not defined for a character, he doesn't have it.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      The GM needs to design the type, number allowed, and drawbacks of Powers in her game. Some examples:
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Types of Powers:</span> <span class="c6">a given campaign may allow magic, psi, superpowers, etc., or some combination of the above. The GM also needs to decide how finely a supernormal power is subdivided. Is ESP a generic Power, or is it split into separate Powers such as Precognition and Clairvoyance? Is magic subdivided into spells, or groups of spells (such as elemental magic) or simply the ability to break the laws of nature in any way that can be imagined? And so on.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Number of Powers allowed</span>: <span class="c6">the GM may set the number of Powers allowed per character. The number may range from one to 20 - or even more. Multiple Powers per character are especially likely in a fantasy campaign where individual spells are separate Powers.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Drawbacks of Powers</span>: <span class="c6">in some campaigns, using a Power may bear a penalty or have some drawback. Typical drawbacks include mental or physical fatigue, lengthy time requirements, unreliable or uncontrollable results, and undesirable side effects (such as loud noises, bad smells, and the like). Some Powers will only work under certain conditions or with certain materials, or are limited to a certain number of uses per day - or month. Others may be risky to the character, affecting physical or mental health. The GM may allow drawbacks to count as faults: a number of them can offset the cost of a Power in the Objective Character Creation system.</span>

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      If a Power logically requires a skill to use it efficiently, the skill must be bought separately. For example, the superpower Flight allows a character to fly, and usually no skill roll is needed. But the ability to make intricate maneuvers in close combat without slamming into a wall requires a roll against a Flying skill. (The GM may ignore this and simply say that no roll is needed for any flying maneuver with a Flight Power.)
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Another common skill is Throwing: hurling balls of fire or bolts of energy at a foe. Or the GM might rule that being able to aim and accurately release such energy comes with the power for free: no roll needed, it automatically hits the target every time unless the target makes a Good Dodge roll (see <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#chapcombat">Chapter 4</a>, Combat, Wounds & Healing).
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      This can be especially true with magic: the ability to cast spells at all may be a gift, but to do it right is a skill, or even many different skills.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph">
      <span class="c6">If a supernormal power can be used to attack a foe, the GM must determine the strength of the Power for damage purposes - preferably during character creation. An offensive Power is usually handled as a propelled weapon, such as a gun, or as being equivalent to a certain melee weapon. This can just be expressed in terms of damage, though, such as Ball of Fire, +6 damage, or large Claws, +3 damage. (See Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secsamplewoundfactors"><span class="Internetlink">4.5.4</span></a><span class="c6">, Sample Wound Factors List.)</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      In the case of a magical or superhero attack, the more potent the attack, the greater the power required, or perhaps the greater the strain on the character who uses it. This can be a penalty to the skill level, greater fatigue, and/or some other disadvantage.

    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Some campaigns will have characters (or animals, monsters, etc.) with traits beyond the human norm. In particular, characters with Strength and Speed well above or below the human range are common in role-playing games. Examples include giants, superheroes, pixies, aliens, ogres, intelligent rabbits, robots, etc.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">In Fudge, Strength, Mass and Speed are rated by the GM in terms of Scale for different races. Most other traits that may be different for non-humans are handled with a Racial Bonus or Penalty rather than being on a different Scale - see Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secracialbonus"><span class="Internetlink">2.3.5</span></a><span class="c6">. Of course, the GM may assign any trait she wishes in terms of Scale.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Humans are of Scale 0, unless some other race is the game-world norm. (E.g., if all the PCs are playing pixies or giants. In these cases, the PCs' race is Scale 0, and humans would be a different Scale.) Non-human races can have a positive or negative number for Scale, depending on whether they are stronger (or bigger or faster) or weaker (or smaller or slower) than humans.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      The word Scale used alone always means Strength/ Mass Scale in Fudge - any other Scale, such as Speed, or Strength without Mass, will be defined as such.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Each level of Strength (from Terrible to Superb) is defined to be 1.5 times stronger than the previous level. A character with Good Strength is thus 1.5 times as strong as a character with Fair Strength. Note that this progression is not necessarily true for any other attribute. There is a wider range of strength in humans than dexterity, for example: Superb Dexterity is only about twice as good as Fair Dexterity.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Strength Scale increases in the same way: a Scale 1, Fair Strength individual is 1.5 times stronger than a Scale 0, Fair Strength individual. This holds for each increase in Scale: a Scale 10 Superb Strength creature is 1.5 times stronger than a Scale 9 Superb Strength creature, for example.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      At this point, it is tempting to say that a Scale 1 Fair Strength is equal to a Scale 0 Good Strength. This is true for Strength, but not for Mass. Scale really measures Mass, or Density, and Strength just goes along for the ride.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      In Fudge, Mass has a specific meaning: how wounds affect a character. (This may or may not coincide with the scientific definition of Mass.) It takes more human-powered hits to weaken a giant than a human, for example. She may not really be a healthy giant, but her sheer bulk means that human-sized sword strokes don't do as much damage relative to her as they would to a human - unless they hit a vital spot, of course. Likewise, a pixie can be healthy and robust, but not survive a single kick from a human. The difference is Mass, and the strength related to it.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      A Scale 1 Fair Strength fighter has an advantage over a Scale 0 Good Strength fighter, even though their Strengths are equal. The Scale 1 fighter is less affected by the other's damage due to his mass. Therefore, do not blithely equate Scale 0 Good with Scale 1 Fair.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">Of course, the GM may envision a less massive but harder to kill race than humans. This is best handled by a Racial Bonus (Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secracialbonus"><span class="Internetlink">2.3.5</span></a><span class="c6">), either as a Toughness Gift (Tough Hide, or Density - either one would subtract from damage), or by a bonus to Damage Capacity.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The GM may decide that increased Mass does not necessarily mean of greater size - the race may be of denser material. Dwarves in northern European legend were derived from stone, and are hence denser than humans. Such a dwarf hits harder and shrugs off damage easier than most humans: he is Scale 1, though shorter than a human. (Of course, the GM should define dwarves' attributes and Scale to her own requirements.)
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Normally, Strength and Mass are handled by a single Scale figure. That is, if a creature is said to be Scale 7, that means Scale 7 Mass and Scale 7 Strength. Strength can vary within each race just as it can for humans. You can have Scale 10 Superb Strength Giants and Scale 10 Terrible Strength Giants. Unlike Strength, though, it is not recommended that Mass vary much within a race. If you do allow Mass to vary for an individual, it should never be worse than Mediocre or better than Good. In fact, it is far better to call Good Mass a Gift, and Mediocre Mass a fault than treat it as an attribute.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The GM may choose to separate Strength Scale from Mass Scale. This would allow Pixies of Strength Scale -6 and Mass Scale -4, for example. However, combat between two Pixies would not work the same as combat between two humans. In this case, they would have a harder time hurting each other than humans would, since their Strength Scale (ability to give out damage) is lower than their Mass Scale (ability to take damage). This may actually be what she wants: a super-strong superhero who can dish out punishment but can't take it can be represented by Strength Scale 10, Mass Scale 2, for example.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Each level of Speed (from Terrible to Superb) is defined to be 1.2 times faster than the previous level. A character with Good Speed is thus 1.2 times as fast as a character with Fair Speed. This is not the same progression as for Strength.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Speed Scale increases in the same manner: a Scale 1, Fair Speed individual is 1.2 times faster than a Scale 0, Fair Speed individual. This holds for each increase in Scale: a Scale 10 Superb Speed animal is 1.2 times faster than a Scale 9 Superb Speed animal, for example.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Speed is not a necessary attribute, of course, and can be ignored entirely if desired. It is included primarily for creatures and vehicles significantly faster than humans. For comparison purposes, assume a Fair Speed human can run at about 10 mph (16 kph) over some distance, provided they are in shape, of course. Sprinting short distance is somewhat faster. This comes to about 15 yards (meters) per three-second combat round.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Note that in short races, you don't really have to roll the dice to see if someone of Superb Speed can beat someone of Good Speed - he can, and will, much more often than rolling the dice would reveal.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The Speed Scale rises too slowly for comparing such things as race cars or space ships to human movement. In these cases, either use a rough human Scale, or simply set the average space ship at Space Ship Speed Scale 0, and rate others relative to it. Thus, the average race car will be roughly human Scale 12 - or you can simply call it Race Car Scale 0, and compare other race cars to it. A Space Ship might be Human Scale 100, or Space Ship Scale 0.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      The Gamemaster should refer to the following table when assigning a Scale to a race. This only has to be done once, at race creation.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      First, the GM should decide how much stronger (or weaker or faster, etc.) the average member of race X is compared to the average human. For example, she decides that Ogres are three times stronger than humans, and pixies are eight times weaker (which equals 0.12 times as strong). She then needs to look up the closest numbers to these strength multipliers on the table below, and look in the corresponding Scale column to find the correct racial Strength/Mass Scales. In this example, Ogres are Scale 3 creatures, while Pixies are Scale -6. (You may envision Ogres and Pixies differently, of course.)

      The Strength/Mass Scale number is figured into damage in combat, and all weapons and armor are assumed to be of the same Scale as the wielder. (These numbers have been rounded to the nearest useful number. They are only roughly 1.5 times the previous number, but close enough for game purposes.)
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Other examples: a GM reads in a Medieval text that a dragon is "as strong as 20 warriors." Looking at the table, 20 times the human norm is Scale 8. However, since the average warrior has Good strength, she chooses Scale 9 for the average dragon in her world. Of course, an individual dragon can still have Poor Strength compared to other dragons. This is simply listed as Strength Poor (-2), Scale 9.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      This same GM wants PC leprechauns to be available. While they are small, she decides their magic makes them a bit stronger than their size would otherwise indicate: Scale -4. So a Good Strength leprechaun is as strong as a Terrible Strength human in her world.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The GM can also use this table to determine relative lifting strength or carrying capacity of characters or beasts if she wishes.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">The GM may require a Strength roll to lift a given object. This will depend on the Scale of the character, of course. Thus, a leprechaun might need a Good Difficulty Level Strength roll to lift a rock that a human could lift without even a roll. (See</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#chapactionresolution">Chapter <span class="Internetlink">3</span></a><span class="c6">, Action Resolution.)</span>

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      If you are using the Objective Character Creation system, each step of increased Strength/Mass Scale for a player character should cost one attribute level and one gift. This is because each level of Scale includes +1 Strength and extra Mass, which is the equivalent of the Tough Hide gift. However, a generous GM may charge less.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      In a superhero game, this gets very expensive, very quickly. An alternative method: let one supernormal power equal a certain Scale. For example, the GM allows one Power to equal Scale 4 (five times as strong as the average human). A character buys three Powers of super strength and has Scale 12 Strength. Another GM allows Scale 13 (200 times as strong as the average human) to equal one Power. Since a character with two Powers in super strength would have Scale 26 Strength (!), the GM decides to limit the amount of super strength available to one Power.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      A player then raises or lowers his character's Strength attribute to show how he compares to the average super-strong superhero. Strength can then be raised to Scale 13 Good, for example, at the cost of one attribute level.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">The GM may also allow separate Mass and Strength for superheroes (or even races). For example, the superhero mentioned in Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secstrengthandmass"><span class="Internetlink">2.3.1</span></a> <span class="c6">with Strength Scale 10 and Mass Scale 2 would only have to pay for two gifts and ten attribute levels. Or, with a generous GM, a single supernormal power covers the entire cost.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Other supernormal powers may have levels. Examples include Telekinesis (increased power allows greater weight to be lifted), Telepathy (increased power equals greater range), Wind Control (increased power allows such things as a jet of wind, whirlwind, or tornado), etc.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      In these cases, each level can be bought as a separate supernormal power, which is expensive. Or you could use the option given above for Scale: one supernormal power buys the supernormal ability at a middling power range, and a simple attribute (or even skill) level raises or lowers it from there.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      For Scales below the human norm, each step of Mass Scale includes a fault equivalent to Easily Wounded, and the GM may allow this to be used to balance other traits like any other fault - see Section <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#sectradingtraits">1.64</a>, Trading Traits.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      There is rarely any need to use Scale for traits other than Strength, Mass and Speed. It's easy to imagine someone wanting to play a race that is slightly more intelligent than humans, but a race ten times smarter than the smartest human is so alien that it would be impossible to play. This is true for most traits - we just can't grasp such extreme differences from our world view.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Actually, there is a way to use intelligence in Scale: in a non-quantified manner. For example, when creating a dog character, you can list:
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      Intelligence: Great (Scale: Dog)
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Since no one is able to quantify inter-species intelligence accurately, do not expect to use it comparatively. It gives an indication that, relative to other dogs, this dog has Great intelligence. The word "Scale" isn't necessary - "Great canine intelligence" works just as well.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The GM should usually use Racial Bonuses or Penalties for traits other than Strength, Mass and Speed. If the GM envisions halflings as being particularly hardy, she can give them a +1 bonus to Constitution: halfling Fair Constitution equals human Good Constitution. As another example, an alien race, Cludds, have a racial penalty of -1 to Intelligence.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">It is best to use trait levels relative to humans on the character sheets, though you should put the racial-relative term in brackets. (Example: Grahkesh, Intelligence Poor [Cludd Fair].) However, always list Strength relative to the character's own race, with the Scale (if other than 0), so the Mass will be accurate. See the sample character, Brogo the Halfling (Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secbrogo"><span class="Internetlink">6.3.1.1</span></a><span class="c6">), for an example of both racial bonus and different Scale.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Racial bonuses and penalties can be used for any type of trait: attributes, skills, gifts, supernormal powers, or faults.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      If using the Objective Character Creation system, each level of a Racial Bonus or Penalty is usually equal to one level of the specific trait raised or lowered normally. That is, if you are granting a +1 to Agility or +1 to Perception for a race, it should cost one attribute level. If a race has a bonus of a Perfect Sense of Direction, it should cost one gift. The innate ability to fly or cast magic spells should cost one supernormal power, etc.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      If a race is at -1 to all Social skills, however, this should only be worth -1 skill level if you have a single skill called Social Skills. If you have many social individual social skills, it should be worth one fault. The converse is true for Bonuses that affect many skills: it should cost one or more gifts.

    </h2>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Some genres allow human characters to develop beyond the realm of the humanly possible. Such campaigns eventually involve planes of existence beyond the mundane as the PCs require greater and greater challenges.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">This style of gaming can be represented in Fudge by Legendary Levels. Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#sectraitlevels"><span class="Internetlink">1.2</span></a><span class="c6">, Levels, introduced the concept of Legendary traits as a goal for PCs to work toward. This section expands that concept infinitely.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      If the GM and players prefer this type of gaming, any skill can be raised beyond Legendary. Instead of renaming each level, simply use a numbering system: Legendary 2nd Level Swordsman, Legendary 3rd Level Archer, etc. Attributes can also be raised, but (except for Strength) this is much rarer.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Each level of Legendary gives a +1 bonus to any action resolution. The character Hugh Quickfinger, for example, has a Longbow skill of Legendary 2nd Level. This gives him a total bonus of +5 (+3 for Superb, and +2 for two levels of Legendary). In any contest against a Fair Longbowman (+0), Hugh should easily triumph.

    </h2>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      If the Gamemaster wishes to include magic in the campaign, it may be easiest to translate whatever magic system she is familiar with into Fudge. If she wishes to craft her own Fudge magic rules, she should consider what she wants magic to be like in her game world.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Questions to ask include: What is the source of magic? Is it a natural process, such as mana manipulation? If it does use mana, does the mage create the mana, or is it inherent in a locale? Or does the mage summon other-world entities to do his bidding? Or must the mage find a source of Power and channel it to his own ends? Or is the source of magic something altogether different?
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Can anyone learn to work magic, or is it an inherent talent (that is, does it require a supernormal power)? Are there levels of Power available, and what would having more levels mean? Is a skill also required? Of course, even if a magician must have a Power to cast spells, there may also be magic items that anyone can use - these are common in tales and legends.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      If beings are summoned, are they evil, good, neutral, confused? How do they feel about being commanded to work for the magician? Can they adversely affect the magician if he fails a spell roll? If Power is being channeled from an external source, is that source in the physical plane or astral? Is it from a living being, or contained in an inanimate object as inert energy, like a piece of coal before going into a fire?
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      What is the process of using magic? Does it involve memorized spells? Physical components? Meditation? Complex and time-consuming ritual? How long does it take to cast a spell? Can a spell be read out of a book? Improvised on the spot?
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      How reliable is magic? Are there any drawbacks? Any societal attitudes toward magicians? Is it common knowledge that magicians exist, or are they a secret cabal, whose doings are only whispered about in ever-changing rumors?
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">Once these issues have been resolved, and the degree of magic in the game decided on, the magic system can be created using Fudge mechanics. A sample magic system, Fudge Magic, is included in Chapter</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#chapaddenda"><span class="Internetlink">7</span></a><span class="c6">, The Addenda.</span>

    </h2>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Fudge assumes miracles are powered by a deity. Some miracles may happen at the deity's instigation (GM whim, or deus ex machina for plot purposes), and some may be petitioned by characters.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Miracles may take place in a startling fashion or in a mundane way. In fact, many people believe that miracles occur daily, but we don't notice them because they appear as simple coincidences. The stranger walking down the road who just happens to have the tools you need to fix your wagon might indeed be just a coincidence, or it may have been divinely arranged that he chanced by at that time. If the tools were simply to appear by themselves, or the wagon fix itself, there would be little doubt that a miracle had occurred. This is neither good nor bad - the GM can choose either method of granting miracles, and need not feel bound to be consistent.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The GM must decide whether miracles can occur in her world, and whether they can be called by character petition. If the latter, then she has to make many other decisions. Can any character petition a particular deity? Does it matter if the character is actually a member of a religious order? How important is the character's behavior - would a deity help a member of a particular religious order even if he had been acting against the deity's goals? How certain is the miracle to occur? How soon will it become manifest? How broad and how specific can requests be? Are any Ritual or Supplication skills needed to petition a deity, or can anyone simply breathe a prayer for help?
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">The answers will vary from GM to GM - no "generic" system of miracles is possible. A sample miracle system, Fudge Miracles, is included in Chapter</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#chapaddenda"><span class="Internetlink">7</span></a><span class="c6">, The Addenda.</span>

    </h2>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Again, it is probably easiest for the GM to translate whatever psionics rules she knows to Fudge. As a simple system, each psionic ability can be a separate supernormal power. The ability to read minds, or foresee the future, or telekinetically move an object, etc., each cost one supernormal power (two gifts). Just how powerful the psionic ability is depends on the level of psi the GM wants for the game world. Someone who can telekinetically lift a battleship is obviously more powerful than someone who can't lift anything heavier than a roulette ball - though the latter may make more money with his power, if he's highly skilled!
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">If the game world has more than one level of power available, then a character must spend multiple free power levels to get the higher levels. See also Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link"><span class="Internetlink">2.3.4</span></a><span class="c6">, Cost of Scale.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      In general, higher levels of Psi Powers equal greater range, or the ability to affect larger or more subjects at once, or access to a greater number of related skills (a low Telepathy Power lets you send your thoughts to another, for example, but greater Power lets you read minds, send painful waves of energy, sense emotions, and possibly even control others). A higher level might also let you use less fatigue or have a lower risk of burnout, take less time in concentration to use, or allow more uses per day, or be used in a broader range of conditions (a low ESP Power can only be accessed in a darkened room, for example, while a high Power level can be used at any time), and so on.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The GM may also require skills to use these powers. Having the psionic ability to use telekinesis just allows you to pick an object up with your mental powers, and move it crudely about. Fine manipulation, such as picking a pocket, requires a successful roll against a telekinetic skill.

    </h2>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      If the campaign allows superpowers similar to those found in comic books, there will probably be a wide variety of powers available. How many an individual character can have depends on the power level of the campaign. A common treatment of superheroes involves faults related to Powers, which makes more Powers available to the character. For example, a super hero is able to fly, but only while intangible. The accompanying fault lowers the cost of the Power to that of a gift.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      There are far too many powers to list in Fudge - browsing through a comic store's wares will give you a good idea of what's available. As with psionics, each power costs one of the free supernormal powers available, and some can be taken in different levels. Potent ones cost two or more of the "average" superpowers.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">Super strength is treated as a separate scale - see Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secnonhumans"><span class="Internetlink">2.3</span></a><span class="c6">, Non-humans.

    </h2>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Artificial limbs, organs, implants and neural connections to computers are common in some science fiction settings. If these grant powers beyond the human norm, they must be bought with supernormal power levels if using the Objective Character Creation system, or with the GM's approval in any case.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      If an implant grants a bonus to an attribute, it should cost as much as the attribute bonus, which is not necessarily as much as a supernormal power. Since an artificial implant may occasionally fail, however, the GM can give a slight cost break by also allowing a free skill level elsewhere on the character sheet.

      This chapter covers how to determine whether or not a character succeeds at an attempted action. In the previous chapters, traits were defined in terms of levels: Superb, Great, Good, etc. This chapter explains how those levels affect a character's chances of success at an action, whether fighting a giant or tracking down a clue.

    </h2>
    <p class="DefinitionTerm c7">
      Dice:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionDefinition c7">
      Various options for dice are given: players may use either three or four six-sided dice (3d6 or 4d6), or two ten-sided dice as percentile dice (d%), or four Fudge dice (4dF), described in the text. It is also possible to play Fudge diceless.
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionTerm c7">
      Unopposed Action:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionDefinition c7">
      some actions are Unopposed, as when a character is trying to perform an action which isn't influenced by anyone else. Examples include jumping a wide chasm, climbing a cliff, performing a chemistry experiment, etc. The player simply rolls the dice and reads the result.
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionTerm c7">
      Rolled Degree:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionDefinition c7">
      this refers to how well a character does at a particular task. If someone is Good at Climbing in general, but the die-roll shows a Great result on a particular attempt, then the rolled degree is Great.
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionTerm c7">
      Difficulty Level:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionDefinition c7">
      the GM will set a Difficulty Level when a character tries an Unopposed Action. Usually it will be Fair, but some tasks are easier or harder. Example: climbing an average vertical cliff face, even one with lots of handholds, is a fairly difficult obstacle (Fair Difficulty Level). For a very hard cliff, the GM may set the Difficulty Level at Great: the player must make a rolled degree of Great or higher to climb the cliff successfully.
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionTerm c7">
      Opposed Action:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionDefinition c7">
      actions are Opposed when other people (or animals, etc.) may have an effect on the outcome of the action. In this case, each contestant rolls a set of dice, and the results are compared to determine the outcome. Examples include combat, seduction attempts, haggling, tug-of-war, etc.
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionTerm c7">
      Relative Degree:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionDefinition c7">
      this refers to how well a character did compared to another participant in an Opposed Action. Unlike a rolled degree, relative degree is expressed as a number of levels. For example, if a PC gets a rolled degree result of Good in a fight, and his NPC foe gets a rolled degree result of Mediocre, he beat her by two levels - the relative degree is +2 from his perspective, -2 from hers.
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionTerm c7">
      Situational Roll:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionDefinition c7">
      the GM may occasionally want a die roll that is not based on a character's trait, but on the overall situation or outside circumstances. This Situational roll is simply a normal Fudge die roll, but not based on any trait. That is, a result of 0 is a Fair result, +1 a Good result, -1 a Mediocre result, and so on. This is most commonly used with Reaction and damage rolls, but can be used elsewhere as needed. For example, the players ask the GM if there are any passersby on the street at the moment - they're worried about witnesses. The GM decides there are none if a Situational roll gives a Good or better result, and rolls the dice. (A close approximation to 50% is an even/odd result: an even result on 4dF occurs 50.6% of the time. Of course, 1d6 or a coin returns an exact 50% probability.)
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionTerm c7">
      Beyond Superb:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionDefinition">
      <span class="c6">it is possible to achieve a level of rolled degree that is beyond Superb. Rolled degrees from Superb +1 to Superb +4 are possible. These levels are only reachable on rare occasions by human beings. No trait may be taken at (or raised to) a level beyond Superb (unless the GM is allowing a PC to be at Legendary, which is the same as Superb +1 - see Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secobjectivedevel"><span class="Internetlink">5.2</span></a><span class="c6">, Objective Character Development). For example, the American baseball player Willie Mays was a Superb outfielder. His most famous catch, often shown on television, is a Superb +4 rolled degree. It isn't possible for a human to have that level of excellence as a routine skill level, however: even Willie was "just" a Superb outfielder, who could sometimes do even better. A GM may set a Difficulty Level beyond Superb for nearly impossible actions.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionTerm c7">
      Below Terrible:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionDefinition c7">
      likewise, there are rolled degrees from Terrible -1 down to Terrible -4. No Difficulty Level should be set this low, however: anything requiring a Terrible Difficulty Level or worse should be automatic for most characters - no roll needed.
    </p>

    </h2>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      There is no need to roll the dice when a character performs an action that is so easy as to be automatic. Likewise, an action so difficult that it has no chance to succeed requires no roll, either - it simply can't be done. Dice are used solely in the middle ground, where the outcome of an action is uncertain.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The GM is encouraged to keep die-rolling to a minimum. Do not make the players roll the dice when their characters do mundane things. There is no need to make a roll to see if someone can cook lunch properly, or pick an item from a shelf, or climb a ladder, etc. Don't even make them roll to climb a cliff unless it's a difficult cliff or the situation is stressful, such as a chase. (And possibly a Superb climber wouldn't need a roll for a difficult cliff. He should get up it automatically unless it's a very difficult cliff.)
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">For any action the player character wishes to perform, the Gamemaster must determine which trait is tested. (This will usually be a skill or an attribute.) If the action is Unopposed, the GM also determines the Difficulty Level - usually Fair.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Of the four dice techniques presented in Fudge, this one is recommended. It gives results from -4 to +4 quickly and easily, without intruding into role-playing or requiring complex math or a table.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Fudge dice are six-sided dice with two sides marked +1, two sides marked -1, and two sides marked 0. They are commercially available from Grey Ghost Press, Inc. - see .
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      You can make your own Fudge dice easily enough. Simply get four normal white d6s. Using a permanent marker, color two sides of each die green, two sides red, and leave the other two sides white. When the ink has dried, spray the dice lightly with clear matte finish to prevent the ink from staining your hands. You now have 4dF: the green sides = +1, the red sides = -1, and the white sides = 0.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      (While you can try to play with normal d6s - reading: 1,2 = -1; 3,4 = 0; 5,6 = +1 - this is not recommended. It takes too much effort, and intrudes into role-playing. 4dF is functionally equivalent to 4d3-8, but this is also not recommended for the same reason, even if you have d6s labeled 1-3 twice.)
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">To use Fudge dice, simply roll four of them, and total the amount. Since a +1 and a -1 cancel each other, remove a +1 and -1 from the table, and the remaining two dice are easy to read no matter what they are. (</span><span class="Emphasis">Example</span><span class="c6">: if you roll +1, +1, 0, -1, remove the -1 and one of the +1s, as together they equal 0. The remaining two dice, +1 and 0, are easily added to +1.) If there is no opposing pair of +1 and -1 dice, remove any zeros and the remaining dice are again easy to read.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The result of a die roll is a number between -4 and +4. At the top of the character sheet, there should be a simple chart of the attribute levels, such as:
    </p>

      To determine the result of an action, simply put your finger on your trait level, then move it up (for plus results) or down (for minus results).

      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Example</span>: Nathaniel, who has a Good Bow Skill, is shooting in an archery contest. The player rolls 4dF, using the procedure described above. If he rolls a 0, he gets a result equal to Nathaniel's skill: Good, in this case. If he rolls a +1, however, he gets a Great result, since Great is one level higher than his Good Archery skill. If he rolls a -3, unlucky Nathaniel has just made a Poor shot.

    <p class="Textbody">
      It is not always necessary to figure the exact rolled degree. If you only need to know whether or not a character succeeded at something, it is usually sufficient for the player simply to announce the appropriate trait level and the die roll result. The game goes much faster this way. For example, a player wants his character, Captain Wallop of the Space Patrol, to fly between two asteroids that are fairly close together. The GM says this requires a Great Difficulty Level Piloting roll and asks the player to roll the dice. The player looks up Captain Wallop's Piloting skill, which is Great, and rolls a +2 result. He simply announces "Great +2" as the result. This answer is sufficient - the GM knows that Captain Wallop not only succeeded at the task, but didn't even come close to damaging his craft.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Of course, there are many times when you want to know exactly how well the character did, even if it's not a matter of being close. If the character is composing a poem, for example, and his Poetry skill is Fair, you will want to figure out what "Fair+2" means: he just wrote a Great poem! There are many other instances where degrees of success is more important than merely knowing success/failure.

    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      For those who don't want to make or buy Fudge dice, three different options are available:
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">4d6:</span> <span class="c6">this method requires 2d6 of one color (or size) and 2d6 of another color or size. First declare which two dice are the positive dice, and which two the negative, then roll all four dice. Do not add the dice in this system. Instead, remove from the table all but the lowest die (or dice, if more than one has the same lowest number showing). If the only dice left on the table are the same color, that is the result: a positive die with a "1" showing is a +1, for example. If there are still dice of both colors showing, the result is "0".</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      Examples (p = positive die, n = negative die): you roll p4, p3, n3, n3. The lowest number is a 3, so the p4 is removed, leaving p3, n3 and n3. Since there are both positive and negative dice remaining, the result is 0. On another roll, you get p1, p1, n2, n4. Remove the highest numbers, n2 and n4. This leaves only positive dice, so the result is +1, since a "1" is showing on a positive die, and there are no negative dice on the table.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">3d6:</span> <span class="c6">Roll 3 six-sided dice. Add the numbers and look up the results on the table below. The table is so small that it could easily fit on a character sheet. Example: a roll of 3, 3, 6 is a sum of 12. Looking up 12 on the table yields a result of +1.</span>

      Thus, if your trait is Fair, and the GM says you need a Good result or better to succeed, you need to roll +1 or better. You'll do this about two times out of five, on the average.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      You'll notice that using 3d6 or 4d6 the results, while slightly different, are close enough for a game called Fudge. The 4d6 results do allow +/-5, however, but this shouldn't be a problem since they occur so rarely. In fact, you could use 5dF to allow +/-5 if you wanted….

    </h2>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      There may be modifiers for any given action, which can affect the odds referred to in the preceding section. Modifiers temporarily improve or reduce a character's traits.

    <p class="Quotations">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Examples</span>: Joe, Good with a sword, is Hurt (-1 to all actions). He is thus only Fair with his sword until he's healed. Jill has Mediocre Lockpicking skills, but an exceptionally fine set of lock picks gives her a Fair Lockpicking skill while she's using them.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      If a character has a secondary trait that could contribute significantly to a task, the GM may allow a +1 bonus if the trait is Good or better.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Example</span>: Verne is at the library, researching an obscure South American Indian ritual. He uses his Research skill of Good, but he also has a Good Anthropology skill. The GM decides this is significant enough to give Verne a Great Research skill for this occasion. If his Anthropology skill were Superb, the GM could simply let Verne use that instead of Research: you don't get to be Superb in Anthropology without having done a lot of research.

      Other conditions may grant a +/-1 to any trait. In Fudge, +/-2 is a large modifier - +/-3 is the maximum that should ever be granted except under extreme conditions.

    </h2>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      For each Unopposed action, the GM sets a Difficulty Level (Fair is the most common) and announces which trait should be rolled against. If no Skill seems relevant, choose the most appropriate Attribute. If there is a relevant Skill, but the character is untrained in it (it's not listed on his character sheet), then use the default: usually Poor. If a high attribute could logically help an untrained skill, set the default at Mediocre. For example, a character wishes to palm some coins without being observed. The GM says to use Sleight of Hand skill, but the character is untrained in Sleight of Hand. The player points out that the character's Dexterity attribute is Superb, so the GM allows a default of Mediocre Sleight of Hand for this attempt.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The player then rolls against the character's trait level, and tries to match or surpass the Difficulty Level set by the GM. In cases where there are degrees of success, the better the roll, the better the character did; the worse the roll, the worse the character did.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">In setting the Difficulty Level of a task, the GM should remember that Poor is the default for most skills. The average trained climber can climb a Fair cliff most of the time, but the average untrained climber will usually get a Poor result. In the example in Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secrollingdice"><span class="Internetlink">3.2</span></a> <span class="c6">(Nathaniel shooting at an archery target), if the target is large and close, even a Mediocre archer could be expected to hit it: Mediocre Difficulty Level. If it were much smaller and farther away, perhaps only a Great archer could expect to hit it regularly: Great Difficulty Level. And so on.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Example of setting Difficulty Level</span>: Two PCs (Mickey and Arnold) and an NPC guide (Parri) come to a cliff the guide tells them they have to climb. The GM announces this is a difficult, but not impossible, cliff: a Good Difficulty Level roll is required to scale it with no delays or complications. Checking the character sheets, they find that Parri's Climbing skill is Great and Mickey's is Good. Arnold's character sheet doesn't list Climbing, so his skill level is at default: Poor. Parri and Mickey decide to climb it, then lower a rope for Arnold.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      Parri rolls a +1 result: a rolled degree of Superb. She gets up the cliff without difficulty, and much more quickly than expected. Mickey rolls a -1, however, for a rolled degree of Fair. Since this is one level lower than the Difficulty Level, he's having problems. Had Mickey done Poorly or even Mediocre, he would perhaps have fallen - or not even been able to start. Since his rolled degree is only slightly below the Difficulty Level, though, the GM simply rules he is stuck half way up, and can't figure out how to go on. Parri ties a rope to a tree at the top of the cliff, and lowers it for Mickey. The GM says it is now Difficulty Level: Poor to climb the cliff with the rope in place, and Mickey makes this easily on another roll.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      Arnold would also need a Poor rolled degree to climb the cliff with the rope, but since his skill is Poor, they decide not to risk it. Mickey and Parri have Arnold loop the rope under his arms, and pull him up as he grabs handholds along the way in case they slip. No roll is needed in this case, unless they are suddenly attacked when Arnold is only half way up the cliff….
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      (The whole situation was merely described as an example of setting Difficulty levels. In actual game play, the GM should describe the cliff, and ask the players how the characters intend to get up it. If they came up with the idea of Parri climbing the cliff and lowering a rope, no rolls would be needed at all - unless, possibly, time was a critical factor, or there were hidden difficulties the GM chose not to reveal because they couldn't have been perceived from the bottom of the cliff.)
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Occasionally, the GM will roll in secret for the PC. There are times when even a failed roll would give the player knowledge he wouldn't otherwise have. These are usually information rolls. For example, if the GM asks the player to make a roll against Perception attribute (or Find Hidden Things skill), and the player fails, the character doesn't notice anything out of the ordinary. But the player now knows that there is something out of the ordinary that his character didn't notice…. Far better for the GM to make the roll in secret, and only mention it on a successful result.

    </h2>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      To resolve an Opposed action between two characters, each side rolls dice (4dF, d%, 3d6, 4d6, or whatever is your chosen dice technique) against the appropriate trait and announces the result. The traits rolled against are not necessarily the same: for example, a seduction attempt would be rolled against a Seduction skill for the active participant (or possibly Appearance attribute) and against Will for the resisting participant. There may be modifiers: someone with a vow of chastity might get a bonus of +2 to his Will, while someone with a Lecherous fault would have a penalty - or not even try to resist.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The Gamemaster compares the rolled degrees to determine a relative degree. For example, Lisa is trying to flimflam Joe into thinking she's from the FBI and rolls a Great result. This is not automatic success, however. If Joe also rolls a Great result on his trait to avoid being flimflammed (Knowledge of Police Procedure, Learning, Intelligence, etc. - whatever the GM decides is appropriate), then the relative degree is 0: the status quo is maintained. In this case, Joe remains unconvinced that Lisa is legitimate. If Joe rolled a Superb result, Lisa's Great result would have actually earned her a relative degree of -1: Joe is not going to be fooled this encounter, and will probably even have a bad reaction to Lisa.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The Opposed action mechanism can be used to resolve almost any conflict between two characters. Are two people both grabbing the same item at the same time? This is an Opposed action based on a Dexterity attribute - the winner gets the item. Is one character trying to shove another one down: Roll Strength vs. Strength (or Wrestling skill) to see who goes down. Someone trying to hide from a search party: Perception attribute (or Find Hidden skill) vs. Hide skill (or Camouflage, Stealth, etc.). Trying to out-drink a rival: Constitution vs. Constitution (or Drinking skill, Carousing, etc.). And so on.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">Some Opposed actions have a minimum level needed for success. For example, an attempt to control a person's mind with a Telepathy skill might require at least a Fair result. If the telepath only gets a Mediocre result, it doesn't matter if the intended victim rolls a Poor resistance: the attempt fails. Most combat falls into this category- see Chapter</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#chapcombat"><span class="Internetlink">4</span></a><span class="c6">.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">For an example of Opposed actions involving more than two characters, see Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secmultiplecombatants"><span class="Internetlink">4.3.4</span></a><span class="c6">, Multiple Combatants in Melee.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      An Opposed action can also be handled as an Unopposed action. When a PC is opposing an NPC, have only the player roll, and simply let the NPC's trait level be the Difficulty Level. This method assumes the NPC will always roll a 0. This emphasizes the PCs' performance, and reduces the possibility of an NPC's lucky roll deciding the game.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      As a slight variation on the above, the GM rolls 1dF or 2dF when rolling for an NPC in an opposed action. This allows some variation in the NPC's ability, but still puts the emphasis on the PCs' actions.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      For those without Fudge dice, the GM can simply roll 1d6 for an NPC. On a result of 2-5, the NPC gets the listed trait level as a result. On a result of 1, the NPC did worse than her trait level; on a result of 6 the NPC did better than her trait level. Those who want to know precisely how much better or worse should roll a second d6:

    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Critical results are an optional Fudge rule for GMs who like the idea. A natural rolled result of +4 can be considered a critical success - the character has done exceptionally well, and the GM may grant some special bonus to the action. Likewise, a natural result of -4 is a critical failure, and the character has done as poorly as he possibly can in the given situation.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Note that achieving +/-4 with die modifiers does not count as a critical result, though the character has done exceptionally well or poorly. When a natural critical result is rolled, the GM may ignore what the rolled degree would be, and treat it as an automatic beyond Superb or below Terrible result.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Optionally, if a character gets a rolled degree four or more levels better than the Difficulty Level, he has gotten a critical success. Likewise, four levels below a Difficulty Level is a critical failure.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      A critical result in combat can mean many things: one fighter falls down, or drops his weapon, or is hurt extra badly, or is stunned for a round and can't even defend himself, or is temporarily blinded, or knocked out, etc. The GM should be creative, but not kill a character outright.

      The GM may even wish to make a table, such as these sample melee critical results:

    </h2>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Sometimes a non-player character has a set reaction to the PCs. Perhaps she's automatically their enemy, or perhaps the party has rescued her, and earned her gratitude. But there will be many NPCs that don't have a set reaction. When the PCs request information or aid, it might go smoothly or it might not go well at all. Negotiation with a stranger is always an unknown quantity to the players - it may be so for the GM, too.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      When in doubt, the GM should secretly make a Situational roll. If the PC in question has a trait that can affect a stranger's reaction, this should grant a +/-1 (or more) to the result. Examples include Appearance (which could be an attribute, gift or fault), Charisma, Reputation, Status, and such habits as nose-picking or vulgar language. The Reaction roll can also be modified up or down by circumstances: bribes, suspicious or friendly nature of the NPC, proximity of the NPC's boss, observed PC behavior, etc.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The higher the Reaction roll result, the better the reaction. On a Fair result, for example, the NPC will be mildly helpful, but only if it's not too much effort. She won't be helpful at all on Mediocre or worse results, but will react well on a Good result or better.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Example</span>: Nathaniel needs some information about the local duke, who he suspects is corrupt. He has observed that folks are reticent to talk about the duke to strangers. Nathaniel decides to approach a talkative vegetable seller at the open market. Nathaniel has an average appearance (no modifier), but is charismatic: +1 to any Reaction roll. He makes small talk for a while, then slowly brings the duke into the conversation. The GM decides this was done skillfully enough to warrant another +1 on the reaction roll. However, the situation is prickly: -2 in general to elicit any information about the sinister local ruler. This cancels Nathaniel's bonuses. The GM rolls in secret, and gets a Fair result. The old lady slips out a bit of useful information before realizing what she's just said. At that point she clams up, but Nathaniel casually changes the subject to the weather, dispelling her suspicions. He wanders off to try his luck elsewhere.

      Unless one participant is unaware of an attack or decides to ignore it, combat is an Opposed action in Fudge. The easiest way to handle combat in Fudge is as a series of Opposed actions. This can be done simply or with more complexity. The author of Fudge uses simple and loose combat rules in order to get combat over with quickly and get back to more interesting role-playing. This chapter, largely optional, is for players who prefer combat options spelled out in detail.

    <p class="DefinitionTerm c7">
      Melee:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionDefinition c7">
      any combat that involves striking the opponent with a fist or hand-held weapon. Any attack from further away is a Ranged attack.
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionTerm c7">
      Story Element:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionDefinition c7">
      a distinct segment of the storyline in the game. In combat, the interval between story elements can be a practical place for a die roll.
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionTerm c7">
      Combat Round:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionDefinition c7">
      an indeterminate length of time set by the GM - around three seconds seems reasonable to some people, while that seems grossly short or absurdly long to others. A given GM's combat round may vary in length, depending on the situation. Generally, when each character involved has made an action, a given round is over.

    <p class="DefinitionTerm c7">
      Offensive damage factors:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionDefinition c7">
      those which contribute to damaging an opponent: Strength (if using a Strength-driven weapon), Scale, and deadliness of weapon.

    </h2>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Fudge gives three options available for handling the pacing of melee combat: moving from story element to story element, using simultaneous combat rounds, or alternating combat turns. An individual GM may devise others.
    </p>
    <h3 id="toc67" class="c71">
      <span class="SectionNumber">4.2.1 -</span> <a target="_self" id="RefHeadingToc199472649761757" name="RefHeadingToc199472649761757"></a><a target="_self" id="secstoryelements" name="secstoryelements"></a>Story Elements
    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      In the simplest combat system, the GM explains the situation in as much detail as is apparent, then asks the players to describe what their characters are doing. The more complete the description of their characters' actions, the better the GM knows how to assess the situation. This can be important if she has something that won't berevealed until the middle of a battle. Die rolls, if any, are required by the GM for each story element.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      A story element is the smallest unit of time in this type of combat resolution. The GM may break the battle down into several story elements, or treat the whole encounter as one element. This depends on the GM's style, the importance of the battle, the number of participants, whether or not there are unexpected surprises, etc. Each element should be a dramatic unit.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      For example, the PCs are faced with a detachment of guards at the door while the evil mastermind is trying to activate the Doomsday machine at the back of the room. The fight with the guards might be one element while the confrontation with Dr. Doomsday could be a second. Another GM might treat the whole battle as one story element, while a third GM would treat each 5-second segment separately. Whatever the number of elements, keep the battle description as word-oriented as possible.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The GM may ask for a single die roll from a player occasionally, or require three rolls and take the median roll.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      (The median is the middle value die roll, which may be the same as either the high or low die roll. For example, if the player rolls a Good, a Mediocre, and a Superb result, the median is Good, since it's the result in between Mediocre and Superb. But a result of Poor, Great, and Great gives a median die roll of Great. Using a median tends to soften the role of extreme luck. Some GMs use a median when a single die result represents many actions.)
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Once the GM has decided which trait (or traits) each PC should use for this combat, she then gives them a modifier, ranging from -3 to +3. Zero should be the most common modifier. The modifier is based partly on how well the PCs' plan would work, given what the GM knows of the NPCs, and partly on circumstances: fatigue, lighting, footing, surprise, weapon superiority, bravery or cowardice of NPCs, wounds, etc.
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      Here is a long example of story element style of combat:
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      Gunner, separated from the other PCs, surprises five members of a rival gang in a garage. The player announces that Gunner will shout and charge the rival mob, carrying his Tommy gun as if he's about to fire - they don't know it's irreparably jammed. He hopes to see them run away, hit the dirt, or freeze in fear. He'll then use his Tommy gun as a club, starting at the left end of their line. He'll keep his current opponent in between him and the others as long as possible. He hopes to then roll up their line, one at a time, keeping the wall to his left side as he charges.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      The GM makes a Situational roll for the mob: Mediocre. The mob members don't recover quickly from their surprise, so she gives Gunner a +1 to his Brawling skill of Good for this plan. She also decides that one mobster will run away and the others won't draw their guns until Gunner has already engaged the first enemy. His Running skill is Great, so she gives him another +1, since he can cover ground quickly. Total modifier for Gunner is +2, bringing his Brawling skill to Superb for this combat. Since this is a fairly long action and she doesn't want a single unlucky roll to ruin Gunner's chances, she asks him for three Brawling skill rolls (at the +2 modifier), and to use the median roll.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      Gunner rolls a Good, Superb, and Great result, in that order. The median roll is Great, and the GM decides this is good enough to have downed the first two mobsters, and describes the battle so far in entertaining detail. Now Gunner is facing the last two thugs, who finally have their pistols out and could probably plug him before he charges that far. The GM asks, "What does Gunner do now?"
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      Gunner hurls the Tommy gun into the face of one gunman while making a low diving tackle for the other, hoping to dodge under any bullets. The GM calls for a single roll against Brawling to cover this whole action: Gunner gets a Fair result. The GM rules that Gunner throws the Tommy gun well enough to distract one gunman, but not harm him. He does, however, manage to tackle and subdue his other foe, whose shots all go wild.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      At this point, the GM rules that the mobster grazed by the thrown Tommy gun now steps over and points his pistol to Gunner's head while he's kneeling over the other mobster. Gunner wisely heeds the call to surrender and hopes his friends can rescue him….

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Those who like their combat broken down into discrete bits can use combat "rounds." In simultaneous action rounds, all offensive and defensive maneuvers happen at the same time. This is realistic: few real combats consist of fighters taking turns whacking at each other.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">The GM determines which traits the combatants should roll against. This depends largely on which weapon they are using, which might simply be a fist. Weapon type also affects damage - see Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secwounds"><span class="Internetlink">4.5</span></a><span class="c6">, Wounds.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Each combatant makes an Opposed action roll. On a relative degree of zero, the combat round is a stand-off - the fighters either circled each other looking for an opening, or exchanged blows on each other's shields, etc. - nobody is hurt.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      A minimum result of Poor is needed to hit a (roughly) equal-sized opponent. That is, a human needs to score a Poor blow (and still win the Opposed action) in order to hit another human. If both opponents roll worse than Poor, the round is a standoff.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      If one opponent is significantly bigger than the other (of a different Scale, at least), he needs a Mediocre or even Fair result to hit his smaller foe, while even a Terrible result will allow the small fighter to hit the larger. (Of course, such a blow must still win the Opposed action.) Extremely small targets, such as a pixie, may require a Good or even a Great result. Examples include humans fighting giants, or very large or small animals.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      If the result is a relative degree other than zero, and the minimum level needed to score a hit is achieved or surpassed, the winner checks to see if he hit hard enough to damage the loser. In general, the better the hit (the greater the relative degree), the greater the likelihood of damage.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">If one combatant is unable to fight in a given round (possibly because he's unaware of the attacker, or because of a critical result in the previous round - see Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#seccriticalresults"><span class="Internetlink">3.6</span></a><span class="c6">, Critical Results), the combat may become an Unopposed Action for the active fighter, usually with a Poor Difficulty Level. If a character can defend himself in some way, such as using a shield, it is still an Opposed Action, but the defending character cannot hurt the other character even if he wins the combat round.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Combat often takes more than one combat round. Characters are not limited to attacking each round - they may attempt to flee, negotiate, try a fancy acrobatic stunt, or any other appropriate action.
    </p>
    <h3 id="toc69" class="c71">
      <span class="SectionNumber">4.2.3 -</span> <a target="_self" id="RefHeadingToc199512649761757" name="RefHeadingToc199512649761757"></a><a target="_self" id="secalternatingcombatturns" name="secalternatingcombatturns"></a>Alternating Combat Turns
    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Using alternating combat turns, each combat round consists of two actions: the fighter with the higher initiative attacks while the other defends, then the second combatant attacks while the first defends. With multiple characters involved in combat, the side with the initiative makes all their attacks, then the other side makes all their attacks. Or the GM may run the combat in initiative order, even if fighters from both sides are interspersed throughout the combat turn.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Gaining initiative is an Opposed action. If the characters don't have an Initiative attribute or skill - such as Reflexes or Speed - simply use Opposed Situational rolls. A gift such as Combat Reflexes can grant a +1 to initiative. Surprise may grant a bonus to the roll, or give automatic initiative. Initiative can be rolled once for each battle or once each round. Perhaps a character could trade skill for initiative: attack hastily (+1 to initiative that round) but be slightly off balance because of it (-1 to attack and defend that round).
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Each attack is an Opposed Action: the attacker's Offensive skill (Sword, Melee Weapon, Martial Art, etc.) against a defender's Defensive skill (Shield, Parry, Dodge, Duck, etc.). This type of combat take longer than simultaneous rounds, but some players feel it gives a character more control over his own fate.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Using these rules, a Defensive parry skill may simply equal the weapon skill, or it may be a separate skill that must be bought independently of an Offensive skill. The GM must tell the players at character creation which method she is using - or allow them extra levels on the fly to adjust their defensive abilities.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Some weapons, such as an Axe, are poor parrying weapons. Players should ask the GM at character creation if a weapon may be used to parry and still be used to attack without penalty in the next turn - and give their characters decent Shield or Dodge skills to compensate for poor parrying weapons.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      All-out offensive and defensive tactics can be used. A character forfeits his attack for a round if he chooses All-out defense, and is at -2 on his defense on his opponent's next turn if choosing All-out offense - or perhaps gets no defense at all!
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The default defense for animals depends on their type: carnivores will usually have a Defense value one level less than their Offense, while this is reversed for most prey species.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Some situations call for one side or the other's trait level to be modified. Here are some examples:
    </p>
    <ul class="c8">
      <li>
        <p class="MyList c87">
          A fighter who is Hurt is at -1, while one who is Very Hurt is at -2.

      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="MyList c87">
          If one fighter has a positional advantage over the other, there may be a penalty (-1 or -2) to the fighter in the worse position. Examples include bad footing, lower elevation, light in his eyes, kneeling, etc.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="MyList c87">
          Subtract the value of a shield from the opponent's weapon skill. A small shield has a value of +1 in melee combat only, while a medium shield has a value of +1 in melee combat and +1 to defense against ranged attacks (if the shield material is impervious to the weapon). A large shield (+2 in all combat) is cumbersome to lug around. The larger the shield carried, the more the GM should assess penalties for things such as acrobatic and other fancy maneuvers. Shields can also be used offensively to push an opponent back, for example, or knock someone over.

      Each fighter then makes a single Opposed action roll as normal.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      When more than one opponent attacks a single fighter, they have, at least, a positional advantage. To reflect this, the lone fighter is at -1 to his skill for each additional foe beyond the first. (For epic-style games, with a few heroes battling hordes of enemies, this penalty can be reduced, or the GM can simply give the hordes Poor skills and low Damage Capacity - which is not out of character for a horde.)
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The lone fighter rolls once, and the result is compared with each of the opponents' rolled degrees, one after the other. The solo combatant has to defeat or tie all of the opponents in order to inflict a wound on one of them. If he beats all of his foes, he may hit the foe of his choice. If he ties his best opponent, he can only wound another whose result is at least two levels below his.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Example</span>: Paco is facing three thugs, who have just rolled a Great, Good, and Mediocre result, respectively. Paco rolls a Great result, tying the best thug. He hits the thug who scored a Mediocre result (at least two levels below his result) and is not hit himself (he tied the best thug).
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      The lone fighter takes multiple wounds in a single round if two or more enemies hit him. Usually, he can inflict damage on only one foe in any given round - his choice of those he bested. It's also possible to allow a sweeping blow to damage more than one foe at a time. Of course, this slows a slash down: reduce damage done by 1 or 2 for each foe cut through.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      A well-armored fighter facing weak opponents can simply concentrate on one foe and let the others try to get through his armor (that is, not defend himself at all against some of his attackers). In this case, the lone fighter can damage his chosen foe even if he is hit by other, ignored foes. This is historically accurate for knights wading through peasant levies, for example. There may or may not be a penalty for the lone fighter in this case.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      There's a limit to the number of foes that can simultaneously attack a single opponent. Six is about the maximum under ideal conditions (such as wolves, or spear-wielders), while only three or four can attack if using weapons or martial arts that require a lot of maneuvering space. If the lone fighter is in a doorway, only one or two fighters can reach him.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">When multiple NPCs beset a lone PC, the GM may wish to use the option in Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secpcsvsnpcs"><span class="Internetlink">4.3.3</span></a><span class="c6">, PCs vs. NPCs. This will save a lot of die rolling.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Alternately, she may wish to roll only once for all the NPCs. The lone fighter is still at -1 per extra opponent. The GM rolls 2dF, and applies the result to each NPC. For example, if the GM gets a +1 result, each attacker scores a +1.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">For those without Fudge dice, the GM could simply use the 1d6 method discussed in Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secopposedactions"><span class="Internetlink">3.5</span></a><span class="c6">, Opposed Actions.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Example</span>: Three NPC pirates, complete with eye-patches, scars, earrings, sneers and generally bad attitudes, are attacking dashing PC hero Tucker. The pirates (whose names are Molly, Annie, and Maggie) are Fair, Good, and Mediocre, respectively, at combat skills. Tucker is a Superb swordsman, but is at -2 for having two extra fighters attacking him at once: his skill is Good for this combat. The GM wants to roll just once (applying the result to all three pirates) rather than rolling three times each combat round.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      Rolling 2dF, she gets a +1 on the first round. The pirates have just gotten Good, Great, and Fair results, respectively. If Tucker scores a Superb result, he could hit the pirate of his choice and remain unhit. On a Great result, Tucker would be unhit, and could land a blow on Maggie. On a Good result, he doesn't hit anyone, but Annie hits him. If Tucker rolls a Fair result, both Molly and Annie would hit him. The process is repeated each round.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      A light blow to an eye is very different from a light blow to an armored shoulder, or to a shield. Using a hit location system adds flavor to combat and the description of a character's equipment, wounds - and scars! Many games have a hit location system, and a GM can easily translate one she is familiar with to Fudge. Or she can use the simple system given here.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The simplest system is not to worry about "called shots." Merely say the better the relative degree, the better the location of the blow. Winning a battle by +8 will allow the attacker to pierce an eye, if desired. Hopefully, the players will describe their actions in such detail that the GM will know how close they came to their objective merely by looking at the relative degree.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      A more complicated system: an attacker can announce that he is aiming at a specific body location - this must be done before rolling to hit. The GM decides the minimum relative degree necessary for such a shot to succeed, usually ranging from 2 to 4, though extreme locations (such as an eyeball) are harder to hit. So if a player wishes his character to hit his opponent's weapon arm, the GM can respond, "You have to win by 2 to do so." If the player then does win by relative degree 2 or more, the weapon arm is hit, and the wound is specific to that arm.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      If the attacker wins the combat round, but not by the minimum relative degree needed to hit the called target, the defender names which part of the body - or shield! - is hit. This will most likely be general body (if there is no shield), but it could be the off-hand, which would carry a lesser combat penalty than a wound to the torso. The GM may have to fudge some here.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      A damaged specific body part can be described as being Scratched (no real game effect), Hurt (a penalty to use, but the body part still functions), and Incapacitated. After battle is the time to decide if an Incapacitated body part can be healed, or is permanently Incapacitated.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      A Hurt body part is generally at -1 to its normal use. A Hurt sword arm gives a -1 penalty to combat, for example, while a Hurt leg is -1 to any running, acrobatics, etc. A Hurt eye is -1 to vision, and so on.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      To determine the exact level of the damage, the GM should consider how well the hit scored, as well as the Strength of the attacker and the weapon being used. Winning by the minimum relative degree necessary to hit the specific body part shouldn't make the victim Incapacitated unless the attacker is of a much larger Scale than the defender. On the other hand, an arm hit with a battle axe wielded by a large, berserk Viking has a good chance of being cut off even if the Viking just rolled exactly what he needed to hit the arm….
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      As a guideline, if the attacker surpasses the relative degree necessary to hit the body part at all, the part is Scratched or Hurt, depending on Strength and weapon deadliness. If he surpasses it significantly, the part is Hurt or Incapacitated.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Species other than humans may have a different list of body parts to hit, and/or different difficulty modifiers.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      A lot of fancy maneuvers are possible in Fudge combat. All require a bit of thought on the GM's part.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      What if you want a Speed or Reflexes trait to affect how often you can strike in combat? How would you handle someone of Good Speed vs. someone of Fair Speed?
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      If someone has a Power that speeds him up beyond the human norm, you can simply have him attack every other round as if his opponent wasn't aware of the attack. That is, every other round, an Unopposed result of Poor or better hits the foe, with no chance to be hit back in return.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      For more subtle differences, the GM may allow an Opposed action to determine if one fighter gets to land a blow first: after declaring their actions, each fighter makes a roll against a Speed trait. The winner of the Opposed action, if any, adds the difference to his weapon skill.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      How about Fudge's "graininess" getting in the way of interesting combat? That is, since there are only seven levels in Fudge, a Good fighter will often meet another Good fighter, and it doesn't seem right that you can't meet someone who's just a little better or worse than you.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      In this case, the GM can create new levels of combat skills (there's no point in using this option with other skills). These new levels require full experience points to reach, but function only as "half" levels, called "plus" levels. Thus, you can have:

      And so on. In any combat, someone with a "+" has the skill level listed before the "+", but gets a +1 every other round, starting with the second round. So in a combat between Gus (skill Great) and Ivan (skill Good +), Gus would have the higher skill on on rounds one, three, five, etc. But on rounds two, four, six, etc., Ivan will roll as if he had a Great skill, thus being Gus's equal those rounds.

      What about swinging on chandeliers and other swashbuckling moves? Since role-playing games have more to do with movies than real life, this should be encouraged if the genre is at all cinematic.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      In these cases, have the player describe his swashbuckling intentions as fully and dramatically as he can. The better the story, the better the bonus to the die roll - or no roll needed if the outcome is entertaining enough. You may then request a roll against Dexterity, or Acrobatics (or even Chutzpah!) and let that determine how well he accomplished his aim. Maybe the swing on the chandelier came off great, but the landing on the banister was a little rough, so the slide down to slam the villain in the back was a tad off, and instead of knocking him out, you merely made him drop his weapon, but then fell on the floor yourself, and now he's mad, and maybe you should get up before he picks up his pistol, or you could try to yank the carpet while you're down there, right next to it, and he seems to standing on it a bit off-balance?

      If the defender is aware of the attack it is an Opposed action: the attacker's ranged weapon skill against the defender's defensive trait. (A Difficulty Level for range, lighting, etc., is still set by the GM, and is the minimum rolled degree needed to hit.) A defensive roll should be made against a Dodge skill, or Agility attribute, or something similar.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      If the ranged weapon is thrown, there is no modifier to the defense roll. However, a propelled weapon, such as a bow, gun, or beam weapon, is much harder to avoid. In this case, reduce the defender's trait by -2 or -3. Obviously, the defender isn't trying to dodge a bullet, but dodging the presumed path of a bullet when an attacker points a gun at him.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Of course, the defender may decline to dodge, but shoot back instead. In this case, the action is Unopposed - making the Difficulty Level is all that is needed to hit. The GM may make such actions simultaneous.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Example</span>: Nevada Slim and the El Paso Hombre are facing off in a showdown. Both are in the open, in the sunlight, so there's no lighting or cover difficulty. The range is obviously the same for both - the GM rules it's a Fair task to hit each other. Slim rolls a Poor result, and the Hombre a Mediocre result. The Hombre's bullet came closer to Nevada Slim than vice versa, but both missed since neither made the Difficulty Level.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Another Example</span>: Will Scarlet is shooting a longbow from the greenwood at Dicken, the Sheriff's man, who has a crossbow. Dicken knows Will is there, because the man next to him just keeled over with an arrow through his chest. Dicken is in the open, in good light, so only range is of any concern to Will Scarlet: the GM says even a Mediocre shot will hit since they are fairly close. The range for Dicken to hit Will is of course the same, but Will is partially hidden behind a log (cover), and just inside the foliage, so the lighting makes it hard to see him clearly. The GM decrees Dicken needs a Good roll to hit Will. Dicken rolls a Fair result, missing Will. Will rolls a Mediocre result, which hits Dicken, even though it wasn't as good a shot as Dicken's.
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      In both examples, the fighters forfeited their Dodges in order to shoot simultaneously. Each combatant needed to make the appropriate Difficulty Level to hit. Under these conditions, it's possible for both combatants to succeed in the same combat round. Had Dicken's shot hit, Will and Dicken would have skewered each other.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Guns and similar weapons that do not rely on muscle power should be rated for damage at the beginning of the game. No detailed list is provided, but as a rough guideline: The average small hand gun might be of +2 to +3 Strength, while a derringer might be +1 or even +0. Powerful two-handed projectile weapons are at +5 and higher, while bazookas and other anti-tank weapons are at +10 and higher. Science fiction small weapons may do as much damage as a modern bazooka - but some are designed to capture people without injuring them.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Automatic weapons can be simulated roughly by allowing more bullets to hit with higher relative degrees. That is, blasting away with a weapon that fires 20 bullets in a combat round and hitting with relative degree +1 - a graze - means only one or two hit the target. If a relative degree +8 represents maximum amount of ammunition on target (whatever that may be for a given weapon), then hitting with a +4 means about half maximum hit the target, while +2 means only one quarter.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      If there is no effective armor, simply add a big damage number if lots of bullets hit: this is going to Incapacitate anyone, at the very least. If armor is at all likely to slow down a bullet, you can't just add a bigger and bigger damage number if more bullets hit: the armor has a chance to slow down each bullet. In this case, rather than roll damage for each bullet, or have them all stopped, the GM needs to fudge some medium result: give a slight damage bonus if more projectiles hit the target.

    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Fudge offers various methods of tracking wounds, with many options. It is impossible to be 100% accurate when simulating damage to such an intricate mechanism as a living being. This is true even for detailed simulations - for an abstract role-playing game, it is hard to get close to reality at all.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Consequently, many GMs don't try to be very accurate, and want a simple system that works and lets the story flow. Others want as much accuracy as they can get. Fudge presents a simple freeform system that works, and suggests some options to make it more mechanical, and encourages each GM to add as much detail as she is happy with.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Combat damage to a character can be described as being at one of seven stages of severity. The stages are:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionTerm c7">
      Undamaged:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionDefinition c7">
      no wounds at all. The character is not necessarily healthy - he may be sick, for example. But he doesn't have a combat wound that's recent enough to be bothering him.
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionTerm c7">
      Just A Scratch:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionDefinition c7">
      no real game effect, except to create tension. This may eventually lead to being Hurt if the character is hit again. This term comes from the famous movie line, "I'm okay, it's only a scratch." The actual wound itself may be a graze, bruise, cut, abrasion, etc., and the GM whose game is more serious in tone may choose to use one of these terms instead.
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionTerm c7">
      Hurt:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionDefinition c7">
      the character is wounded significantly, enough to slow him down: -1 to all traits which would logically be affected. A Hurt result in combat can also be called a Light Wound.
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionTerm c7">
      Very Hurt:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionDefinition c7">
      the character is seriously hurt, possibly stumbling: -2 to all traits which would logically be affected. A Very Hurt result can also be called a Severe Wound.
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionTerm c7">
      Incapacitated:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionDefinition c7">
      the character is so badly wounded as to be incapable of any actions, except possibly dragging himself a few feet every now and then or gasping out an important message. A lenient GM can allow an Incapacitated character to perform such elaborate actions as opening a door or grabbing a gem….
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionTerm c7">
      Near Death:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionDefinition c7">
      the character is not only unconscious, he'll die in less than an hour - maybe a lot less - without medical help. No one recovers from Near Death on their own unless very lucky.
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionTerm c7">
      Dead:
    </p>
    <p class="DefinitionDefinition c7">
      he has no more use for his possessions, unless he belongs to a culture that believes he'll need them in the afterlife….
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      The GM may expand or contract these stages. For example, expand Hurt and Very Hurt to Light Wound, Moderate Wound and Severe Wound. In this case, a Severe Wound might be -3 to all actions - or the GM might leave it at -2, make Moderate Wound = -1, and make Light Wound something in between a Scratch and Moderate Wound. That is, maybe a Light Wound causes no penalty during combat (you don't notice such a slight wound in the heat of battle), but after combat the character will be at -1 to all skills until it's healed (such wounds can be annoying later).
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The GM may allow a high Difficulty Level Willpower roll to reduce or even nullify penalties listed at Hurt, Very Hurt, and possibly Incapacitated. A gift of a High Pain Threshold will reduce the penalties by one level, while a fault of a Low Pain Threshold will increase penalties by one.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Some players delight in describing their characters' wounds in detail, even writing resulting scars into the character story.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Automatic Death:</span> <span class="c6">sometimes you don't have to roll the dice. Holding a knife to a helpless character's throat is a good example - no roll needed to kill such a character, but the killer's karma suffers.</span>

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph">
      <span class="c6">In Fudge, Damage Capacity determines how wounds affect a character. Damage Capacity may be called Hit Points, if desired. It may be tied to a character trait such as Constitution (or Hardiness, Fitness, Health, Body, Strength, etc.), or it may be a separate trait - see Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#seccharexamples"><span class="Internetlink">6.3</span></a><span class="c6">, Character Examples. It can also be treated as a gift/fault.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The GM decides how to handle the differing abilities of humans to take damage. It really does vary, but how much is open to debate.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      As an extreme example, take the death of the Russian monk Rasputin, the adviser to Czarina Alexandra, in 1916. He was fed enough cyanide to kill three normal people, but showed no signs of it. He was then shot in the chest and pronounced dead by a physician. A minute later he opened his eyes and attacked his assassins! They shot him twice more, including in the head, and beat him severely with a knuckle-duster. He was again pronounced dead, tied in curtains and ropes, and tossed into a river. When his body was retrieved three days later, it was found he had freed an arm from his bindings before finally dying of drowning! Clearly, the man could soak up damage well beyond most peoples' abilities. He is not unique, however: there are many cases in history of people being hard to kill.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      On the other hand, the phrase "glass jaw" is familiar to most English speakers, referring to those who are hurt from the slightest blow.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      So there is undoubtedly some room for variation in damage capacity in characters.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      If the GM is handling wounds in a freeform matter, make Damage Capacity an attribute and let players rate their characters in it like any other attribute. Or have a gift (Damage Resistant, perhaps) and a fault (Fragile, maybe), and let everyone without either the gift or the fault be normal in this regard. The GM can assess the character's ability to take damage based on that information and the situation at hand.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      If the GM wants a more numerical approach to wound determination, it requires some forethought. If Damage Capacity is an attribute, the easiest way to rate it numerically in Fudge is the standard:
    </p>
    <ul class="c8">
      <li>
        <p class="MyList">
          +3 for Superb Damage Capacity
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="MyList">
          +2 for Great Damage Capacity
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="MyList">
          +1 for Good Damage Capacity
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="MyList">
          +0 for Fair Damage Capacity
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="MyList">
          -1 for Mediocre Damage Capacity
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="MyList">
          -2 for Poor Damage Capacity
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="MyList">
          -3 for Terrible Damage Capacity
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">However, since light metal armor, as listed in Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secsamplewoundfactors"><span class="Internetlink">4.5.4</span></a><span class="c6">, Sample Wound Factors List, only grants a +2 to defense against being wounded, it is easily seen that a Great Damage Capacity is equal to light metal armor. Some GMs will find this absurd: a naked person of Great Damage Capacity can turn a sword as well as an armored person of Fair Damage Capacity. Others will remember Rasputin, and consider it within the bounds of reason - it could be part body size (vital organs harder to reach) and part healthiness (muscle tissue more resistant to being cut).</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      For simplicity, any equation-driven approach to wounds in Fudge assumes the GM will use a Damage Capacity attribute, and it is rated from +3 to -3, as listed above. If you are not happy with this, please make the necessary mental substitution.
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      Here are some other possible ways to handle Damage Capacity numerically:
    </p>
    <ol class="c88">
      <li>
        <p class="MyList c87">
          Make Damage Capacity an attribute, as above, but instead of automatically granting a bonus, require a Damage Capacity die roll every time a character is hit for at least a Light Wound (Hurt result). On a result of:
        </p>
        <ul class="c177">

              <span class="StrongEmphasis">Great or better:</span> <span class="c6">reduce the severity of the wound by one.</span>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="MyList c87">
              <span class="StrongEmphasis">Mediocre to Good:</span> <span class="c6">no adjustment to the severity of the wound.</span>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="MyList c87">
              <span class="StrongEmphasis">Poor or worse:</span> <span class="c6">increase the severity of the wound by one.</span>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ol class="c88">
      <li class="c178">
        <p class="MyList c87">
          This adjustment can either be one wound level, or simply one damage point, as the GM sees fit.
        </p>
        <p class="MyList c87">
          For certain types of damage - perhaps from a stun ray or a quarterstaff across the ribs - the GM can use the values from +3 to -3 without requiring a roll.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="MyList c87">
          Do not use a Damage Capacity attribute; instead allow the players to take a gift of Damage Resistant (reduces wound severity by one) or a fault of Fragile (increases wound severity by one). Again, this adjustment can be one wound level, or one damage point.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="MyList c87">
          <span class="c6">Use a Damage Capacity attribute, as outlined as the first suggestion under Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secrecordingwounds"><span class="Internetlink">4.5.7</span></a><span class="c6">, Recording Wounds.

      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="MyList c87">
          Use a Willpower attribute instead of Damage Capacity. GMs who believe that Rasputin was able to overcome so much damage because his will was focused on overcoming his enemies may use this method. Grant an adjustment to the wound level based on the result of a Willpower die roll. This can be temporary - until the battle is over - or actually have a permanent affect on reducing wound severity.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      When determining how wounded a character is when hit in combat, take into consideration all of the following factors:
    </p>
    <ol class="c88">
      <li>
        <p class="Textbody c7">
          The relative degree the attack succeeded by - the better the hit, the greater likelihood of damage. Winning a combat round with a relative degree of +1 means you probably hit where the opponent is most heavily armored. Scoring a hit with a +3 finds a chink in the armor.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="Textbody c7">
          The strength of the blow. For muscle-powered weapons, such as melee weapons, unarmed attacks, bows, slings, etc., this is determined by the attacker's Strength attribute: stronger folks tend to hit harder. The relative Scale modifier is also figured in here. For things like guns, beam weapons, etc., it is relative to the nature of the weapon: a .38 usually does more damage than a .22. The technological level of the weapon can be important.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="Textbody c7">
          The deadliness of the attacker's weapon. Big weapons tend to do more damage than little weapons; sharp weapons rip tissue more than dull ones, but blunt weapons can cause concussive damage through armor thick enough to stop a sharp weapon. People trained in Karate tend to do more damage than those untrained in any martial art.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="Textbody c7">
          The defender's armor. People wearing thicker armor, and more of it, tend to get hurt less than those wearing no armor. Armor can be finely differentiated, or simply said to be Light, Medium, or Heavy armor. Science fiction scenarios will have Extra-Heavy armor, and even further levels. Fantasy campaigns may include magic armor that offers even greater protection, sometimes specific against certain types of damage.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="Textbody c7">
          The amount of damage the victim can soak up (Robustness, Damage Capacity, or Mass). Big, healthy guys can take more damage before collapsing than little, sickly guys. But it's your call if it's a big, sickly fighter against a little, healthy fellow.

Example: if using a large mace (+2 weapon) against plate armor (+4 armor), the armor only counts as +2 armor.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph">
      <span class="c6">A given blow will cause a certain level of wounding. In the simplest wound determination system, the GM assesses all of the Wound Factors (Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secwoundfactors"><span class="Internetlink">4.5.3</span></a><span class="c6">) and announces how bad the wound is. (In some cases, however, the PCs won't know the precise degree of damage. In those cases, the GM can simply say, "You think you wounded her, but she's still on her feet," or, "You don't notice any effect.")</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      As an example, the GM thinks to herself, "Okay, the fighter with Good Strength just scored a Great hit with a broadsword. The loser rolled a Fair combat roll, has Good Damage Capacity and heavy leather armor. Hmmm - I'll say the Strength and Damage Capacity cancel each other, while the sharp sword should be able to penetrate the leather armor if the blow is good enough. A Great hit against a Fair defense is enough, but not really massive: I'd say the loser is Hurt." This result would then be announced to the loser of the combat round.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The GM can also use a Situational roll to help her. Roll the dice behind a GM screen, and let the result guide you. A roll of -1 to +1 isn't significant - no change from what you decided. But a roll of +3 or +4 adds a wound level or two to the damage.

    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">That system, while simple and satisfying to a certain type of GM, doesn't do much for those who prefer the system detailed in Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secsamplewoundfactors"><span class="Internetlink">4.5.4</span></a><span class="c6">, Sample Wound Factors List.

      One system that uses the offensive and defensive factors requires finding the total damage factor. This is derived by adding up all the attacker's offensive factors and then subtracting all the defender's factors.

    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      Since Theodora's damage factor is larger, if she hits him, she'll do more damage to him than he would to her for an equally well-placed blow.

      The numbers above the wound levels represent the amount of damage needed in a single blow to inflict the wound listed under the number. For example, a blow of 3 or 4 points Hurts the character, while a blow of 5 or 6 points inflicts a Very Hurt wound.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      These numbers can be customized by the GM to fit her conception of how damage affects people. Raising the numbers makes it harder to wound someone, while lowering them makes combat more deadly.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Note that there is no number given for Dead. This is left up to the GM, and deliberately not included to prevent accidental PC death.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      However, you can't simply use the damage factor you determined above - relative degree is also important.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">A relative degree of +1 is treated as a graze - see Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secgrazing"><span class="Internetlink">4.5.6</span></a><span class="c6">, Grazing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">Otherwise, simply add the relative degree to the damage factor.

    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The result is a number that may or may not be a positive number. If it's zero or less, no damage is scored.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      If the number is positive, look up the result across the top of the wound levels, and figure the wound as described above. If Leroy hits Theodora with a relative degree of +2, he adds that to his damage potential of +2 to produce a damage number of 4. Looking down, we see that a result of 4 is a Hurt result (Light Wound). Theodora is Hurt, and at -1 until she is healed.

    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      There are other ways to figure damage. A GM who believes the relative degree is more important than the damage factor would double it before adding it to the damage factor. The numbers above the wound levels should be adjusted in this case:

      Any relative degree of +1 can do at most a GM-set Wound level (plus any Scale difference). It may do no damage at all, depending on the opponent's defensive factors: a fist hitting plate mail won't hurt the armored knight in the slightest - unless it's a giant's fist.

      Scale difference is a little trickier to figure, but it should be minimized for such a narrow victory: a giant's club could give a human a glancing blow that might inflict a Very Hurt result, but not necessarily Incapacitate.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph">
      <span class="c6">Once the final damage is determined, it is recorded on the wounded fighter's character sheet. Each individual wound is described as a Scratch, Hurt (Light Wound), etc., as introduced in Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secwoundlevels"><span class="Internetlink">4.5.1</span></a><span class="c6">, Wound Levels.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Use a Damage Capacity attribute as an easy way to record wounds. (In this case, Damage Capacity is not figured into determining wound severity.) Each hit that is greater than a Scratch reduces a character's Damage Capacity attribute one level - or more, if the GM deems the hit to be severe enough. (Scratches can accumulate as the GM desires - perhaps three Scratches equal one hit.)
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      When someone is reduced to Mediocre Damage Capacity, he is Hurt: -1 to all actions. When he is at Poor Damage Capacity, he is Very Hurt: -2 to all actions. When he drops to Terrible, he is at -3 to all actions - or Incapacitated, if a GM wishes to play it that way. Damage Capacity below Terrible is Incapacitated, at least - possibly worse.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      (For characters of Mediocre or worse Damage Capacity, these levels only affect them when damaged. That is, an undamaged character of Mediocre Damage Capacity is not at -1 to all actions. However, if he takes even one hit, he drops to Poor Damage Capacity, and is at -2 to all actions.)
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">Healing in such a system cannot raise Damage Capacity above a character's undamaged level - that can only be raised through Character Development (see Chapter</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#chapchardevel"><span class="Internetlink">5</span></a><span class="c6">).</span>

      Note that an "H" is recorded under the Incapacitated label. The character is indeed Incapacitated - he can't fight any more - but for healing (and scarring) purposes, he has only received two Hurt wounds and one Very Hurt wound - never an Incapacitating wound in one blow. Since Incapacitating blows are harder to heal from, this is important.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      As another example, a character that takes two Very Hurt results without taking any other hits is Incapacitated, since that is the next highest wound level.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Note that three boxes are provided under Scratch. This can be customized by each GM, of course. A Scratch wound will not make a fighter Hurt until he receives his fourth Scratch. Optionally, a Scratch will never raise a character's wound level beyond Very Hurt, no matter how many he takes. The GM should not to use this rule when the PCs fight a monster of huge Scale. Otherwise, they'd never be able to kill such a creature when the worst wound they can inflict is a Scratch.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The wound progression above makes for a fairly realistic campaign. For a more cinematic campaign (especially those without magic or science fiction healing), add an extra box for Scratch, Hurt, and possibly Very Hurt: lesser blows won't accumulate so quickly to hinder the character. A moderately cinematic character sheet looks like:

      It wouldn't be out of line, for an epic scale game, to add up to two more boxes to Hurt and Very Hurt. <span class="c6">Be warned that adding boxes can lengthen combat significantly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Never add boxes for cannon-fodder NPCs, though you may wish to do so for major NPCs. In fact, NPC pawns don't even need the system above. A simple three-stage system of Undamaged, Hurt, Out of the Battle is good enough for most of them. Simply make a mark under an NPC's name for Hurt, and cross out the name for Out of the Battle.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      The attacker's Strength Scale is added to his offensive damage factors, and the defender's Mass Scale is added to her defensive damage factors. If you have combat with beings weaker than humans, remember what you learned in school about adding and subtracting negative numbers….
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">Armor and weapons affect the damage done normally, since they are scaled to the folks using them. Hits become Scratches, Hurt, etc., as usual - see Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secdeterminingwoundlevel"><span class="Internetlink">4.5.5</span></a><span class="c6">, Determining Wound Level.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      However, an extremely small character is not likely to be able to wound a large one in the numerical value wounding system. The GM may allow a point or two of damage to penetrate if the small character gets a critical success. Poison-tipped arrows and lances are also a possibility: the small character can aim for joints in the armor and merely has to break the skin to inject the poison.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Also, this system treats Mass Scale like armor, which isn't quite accurate. In reality, a small opponent may be slowly carving the larger fighter up, but each wound is too petty, relative to the large scale, to do much damage by itself. To reflect a lot of small wounds gradually inflicting a hit on a large-scale foe, allow a damage roll when Scale prevents a hit from doing any damage - that is, when Scale is the only difference between getting a Scratch and no damage at all. See Section <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secdamagedieroll">4.61</a>, Damage Die Roll.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      There are also "scale piercing" weapons, such as whale harpoons and elephant guns. These don't have massive damage numbers: instead, if they hit well, simply halve the Scale value, or ignore it all together. Of course, if such a weapon is used on a human, it would indeed have a massive damage modifier….
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Combat Examples:</span> <span class="c6">In the following examples, each fighter's Strength Scale equals his own Mass Scale, but not his opponent's. (E.g., Wilbur's Strength is Scale 0 and his Mass is Scale 0.) Also, it is assumed the GM is not using the optional damage roll, which could vary damage in all three combats discussed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations c74">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">First example:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations c74">
      Sheba, a human warrior, has just kicked McMurtree, a wee leprechaun.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations c74">
      <span class="NoFormat c179">▶</span> Sheba's offensive damage factor = +1:<br>
      - Fair Strength: +0<br>
      - Unarmed Combat Skill, with thick boots: +1<br>
      - Scale: +0
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      (Sheba's martial art skill normally earns her a +0 to damage, and boots normally earns a +0. The GM rules that using both together allows a +1, however.)
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations c74">
      <span class="NoFormat c179">▶</span> McMurtree's defensive damage factor is -3:<br>
      - Light Leather Armor: +1<br>
      - Fair Damage Capacity: +0<br>
      - Scale: -4.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations c74">
      <span class="NoFormat c179">◆</span> Sheba's damage factor against McMurtree is 1-(-3) = +4. (Subtracting a negative number means you add an equal but positive amount.)
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      If Sheba wins the first combat round with a relative degree of +2 she scores a total of 4+2 = 6 points. McMurtree's player looks up 6 on the wound table on his character sheet: Very Hurt - he's at -2 for the next combat round, and in grave danger if she hits again.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations c74">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Second example:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations c74">
      McMurtree's friend, Fionn, now swings his shillelagh (oak root club) at Sheba's knee.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations c74">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis"><span class="NoFormat c179">▶</span></span> Fionn's offensive damage factor is -1:<br>
      - Good Strength: +1<br>
      - Shillelagh: +2 (medium sized relative to Fionn, not sharp)<br>
      - Scale: -4
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations c74">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis"><span class="NoFormat c179">▶</span></span> Sheba's defensive damage factor is +2:<br>
      - Heavy Leather Armor: +2<br>
      - Scale: +0
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations c74">
      <span class="NoFormat c179">◆</span> Fionn's damage factor against Sheba is -1-2 = -3.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      If Fionn wins by +3, a solid blow, he adds -3+3 = 0. Unfortunately for Fionn, she takes no damage from an excellently placed hit.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      Fionn had better think of some other strategy, quickly. Fortunately for Fionn, he knows some magic, and if he can dodge just one kick from Sheba, she'll learn the hard way why it's best not to antagonize the Wee folk….
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations c74">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Third example:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations c74">
      Wilbur, a human knight with a sword, is attacking a dragon.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations c74">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis"><span class="NoFormat c179">▶</span></span> Wilbur's offensive damage factor is a respectable +6:<br>
      - Great Strength: +2<br>
      - Two-handed sword: +4 (+3 for size, +1 for sharpness)<br>
      - Scale: +0
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations c74">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis"><span class="NoFormat c179">▶</span></span> The dragon's defensive damage factor is +8:<br>
      - Fair Damage Capacity: +0<br>
      - Tough hide: +2<br>
      - Scale: +6
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations c74">
      <span class="NoFormat c179">◆</span> Wilbur's damage factor against the dragon is therefore 6-8 = -2.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      If Wilbur hits the dragon with a relative degree of +3, he does 3-2 = 1 point of damage. Given his Strength, weapon, and the amount he won by, this would be a severe blow to a human, even one wearing armor. But this is no human opponent. Only one point get through the dragon's Scale and tough hide. The GM checks off a Scratch for the dragon, and the fight continues. Since there are three Scratch boxes for a major NPC, Wilbur will have to do this thrice more before he finally Hurts the dragon. He may need help, or have to go back for his magic sword.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Although the damage roll is optional, it is recommended if you are using numerical damage factors. This is because the damage factors are generally fixed for the entire fight, and things tend to get stagnant. It also allows a tiny fighter to have a chance against a larger foe - a satisfying result.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      There are many possible ways to use a damage die roll.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      One could roll a single Fudge die for a result of -1, 0, or +1. This can be added to the damage factor, or, more broadly, to the actual wound level.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      For example, if a fighter inflicts 4 points of damage, that is normally a Hurt result. If a +1 on 1dF is rolled, however, that can make the result +5 (if adding to the damage factor), which brings it up to Very Hurt result. However, a -1 wouldn't change the wound: it would lower the result to 3, which is still a Hurt result. But if the GM is using 1dF to alter the wound level, then a -1 changes the result to a Scratch, since that's one wound level below Hurt.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Instead of a separate damage roll, one could simply use the die rolls used to resolve the Opposed action. If the attacker wins with an even roll (-4, -2, 0, +2, +4), add one to his offensive factor. If he wins with an odd result (-3, -1, +1, +3), his offensive factor is unchanged. Do the same for the defender, except it affects his defensive factor. This system will help the defender 25 25 time.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Example</span>: the defender loses the combat round, but rolls his trait level exactly (die roll of 0): he adds one to his defensive damage factor. The attacker wins with a die roll of +3: his offensive damage factor is unchanged. The final damage number is reduced by one - the defender, although losing the round, managed to dodge left as the attacker thrust a bit to the right, perhaps. He may still be wounded, but he got his vital organs out of the way of the blow.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      This system could also be applied to the wound level instead of the damage factor.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">A more complicated system uses a Situational roll (result from -4 to +4, not based on any trait), and adds it to the calculated damage number (the number over the wound level), as found in Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secdeterminingwoundlevel"><span class="Internetlink">4.5.5</span></a><span class="c6">, Determining Wound Level. Negative final damage is treated as zero damage.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The GM may wish to apply some limitations to the damage roll, to restrict too wild a result. For example:
    </p>
    <ol class="c88">
      <li>
        <p class="Textbody c7">
          If the calculated damage is positive, the damage roll cannot exceed the calculated damage. That is, if the calculated damage is +2, any damage roll of +3 or +4 is treated as +2, for a total of 4 points of damage.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="Textbody c7">
          If the calculated damage is positive, the final damage cannot be less than +1.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="Textbody c7">
          If the calculated damage is negative or zero, the final damage may be raised to a maximum of +1 by a damage roll.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="Quotations">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">First Example</span>: The calculated damage is found to be -2 due to armor and Scale. It would take a +3 or +4 die roll to inflict a wound on the defender in this case, and then only 1 point of calculated damage: a Scratch.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Second Example</span>: The calculated damage is +2 (a Scratch). A damage roll of +2 to +4 results in final damage of four points, since calculated damage cannot be more than doubled by a damage roll. A damage roll of +1 results in final damage of three points, while a damage roll of 0 results in two points of final damage. Any negative die roll results in one point of final damage, since a positive calculated damage cannot be reduced below one by a damage roll.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      For simplicity, of course, the GM can simply ignore the limitations, and allow the damage roll to be anywhere from -4 to +4, let the chips fall where they may….
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Many other damage die rolls are possible - these are only given as examples to the GM.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      A player can announce that his character is trying to stun or knock his opponent out rather than damage her. Using the flat of a blade instead of the edge, for example, can accomplish this. Damage is figured normally, but any damage inflicted doesn't wound the opponent: it stuns her instead.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      In this case, a Hurt result is called a "Stun" - a stunned character cannot attack or all-out defend, and is at -1 to defend for one combat turn only. However, the Stun result stays on the character sheet: that is, a second Stun result, even if delivered more than one combat round after the first, will cause the character to become Very Stunned. (Stun results heal like Scratches: after combat is over.)
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      A Very Hurt result in a stunning attack is called a Very Stunned result instead: no attacks and -2 to all actions for two combat rounds.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      A result of Incapacitated or worse when going for stun damage results in a knockout. A knocked-out character doesn't need healing to recuperate to full health - just time. (Only a harsh GM would roll for the possibility of brain damage - this is fiction, not reality.)
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The GM may simply decide that a successful Good blow (or better) to the head knocks someone out automatically. In an Opposed action, the Good blow would also have to win the combat, of course.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Likewise, a player may choose to have his character do reduced damage in any given attack. This is known as "pulling your punch," even if you are using a sword. This commonly occurs in duels of honor, where it is only necessary to draw "first blood" to win, and killing your opponent can get you charged with murder. A Scratch will win a "first blood" duel - it is not necessary to Hurt someone.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      To pull your punch, simply announce the maximum wound level you will do if you are successful. A fencer can say he is going for a Scratch, for example. In this case, even if he wins the Opposed action by +8, and adds in +3 for his sword, the worst he can do is nick his foe. He was just trying for a Scratch - but the Scratch is probably in the shape of the letter "Z" with such a result!

      This system of wound determination does not pretend to be a realistic method, and can produce some wildly varying results. But it's quick, easy, and lots of fun, and so works well in a certain style of gaming.

      This system requires 3d6 for a damage roll, even if using 4dF for action resolution.

      The median is the value in the middle. This may be the same as the highest or lowest, as in a roll of 2, 4, 4: the Min = 2, the Mid = 4, and the Max = 4. A roll of triples means Min = Mid = Max. (Please read the median value - not necessarily the die that is physically between the other two on the table.)
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Once you have determined which die to read, compare it with the numbers above the wound levels. With a roll of 1, 3, 5, for example, the Min die = 1 (a Scratch result), the Mid die = 3 (a Hurt result), and the Max die = 5 (a Very Hurt result). You would only read one of these results, however - not all three.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      With three or more bonuses, add the appropriate dice as listed on the table. For results beyond 9, the GM is free to kill the recipient outright, or merely keep it as a Near Death result, as called for by the situation.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The tables are not meant to be intrusive, merely guidelines. The basic intent is to read the Mid if the attacker has either a decent damage factor or a decent relative degree; to read the Min if he has neither; and to read the Max if he has both. All other values are derived from that simple idea. So the GM can ignore all the tables, and with that idea in mind, just fudge which die to read.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      For example, a GM might say, "Whoa! You just hit him across the forehead as he backed into a bucket left by the hastily fleeing janitor. Nice shot - he topples over onto his back. For damage, roll 3d6 and read the Max!"

      On the first round, Rachel wins by +2, whacking Archie across the ribs. Relative degree +2 doesn't get any bonus (and she has none from her damage factor), so Rachel will read the Min.

      On the second round, Archie manages to win with a graze: +1 relative degree. Do not even calculate a bonus in this case - use the graze rule unchanged from Section 4.56, Grazing. His damage factor is only 4, so he scores a Scratch on Rachel.

      On the third round, Archie does very well: he wins by +4 as Rachel backs into a chair! He now gets two bonuses, one from his damage factor and one from his relative degree: he will read the Max die. But Archie's karma is in serious need of overhaul: he rolls a 1, 2, and 3. Rachel is only Hurt, and the GM checks off the Hurt box.

    <p class="Quotations">
      Rachel all-out attacks in the following round, and with the +1 to hit she scores an awesome +6 over Archie! She gets two bonuses for such a high relative degree - she'll read the Max die - and gets +1 to the die roll for all-out attacking. (Note that this is +1 to the die result, not a +1 to the die-reading bonus.) The GM rolls a 1, 4, 6. She reads the Max and adds 1 for a total of 7. Reading the wound table on the character sheet, she sees that this is Incapacitated, and declares that Rachel's staff just smashed across the bridge of Archie's nose, probably doing serious damage, and at least knocking him out of this battle….

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Sometimes the dice try to kill a PC. In most campaigns, PC death shouldn't occur through a bad die roll, but only if the character's actions were truly self-sacrificing - or stupid - enough to warrant death. Three methods of preventing accidental PC death are presented. They may be used separately or together or not at all.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      These should not be used for run-of-the-mill NPCs, but could be used for major ones.

    </p>
    <ol class="c88">
      <li>
        <p class="MyList c87">
          A character cannot take more than three levels of wounds in one blow. For example, an unwounded character could be Scratched, Hurt, or Very Hurt in one blow, but any excess damage points beyond that would be lost. A Hurt character could go all the way to Near Death in one blow, but not be killed outright.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="MyList c87">
          A character cannot be rendered Near Death unless he began that combat round Incapacitated. This is simpler to keep track of than the first system, and assumes there is some great difference between a severe wound and mortal wound. There probably isn't, but the rule isn't intended to be realistic: it's to make the PCs more heroic than real life.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Technological differences between weapons and armor can be expressed as Scale if the GM desires. Instead of figuring exactly how much mega-damage a transvibrational subneural pulverizer does, the GM can simply say, "This is a weapon that is of the same technological level as the armor of the defender - therefore, it has the same effect on her as a modern pistol would on kevlar." However, if used against someone who is wearing kevlar, the transvibrational subneural pulverizer does lots and lots of damage - kevlar wasn't designed to stop this type of thing.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Basically, there isn't much difference between thrusting a sword through a naked man's kidney, or shooting him with a .38 through the kidney, or using a transvibrational subneural pulverizer on the kidney: naked people don't resist most weapons well. Plate armor stops the sword well, but won't slow down the .38 enough to help much - unless it can deflect it away from the kidney, that is. It probably won't help at all against the pulverizer, but it may: the GM will have to decide the effect of such a weapon on plate armor.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The concept of technological levels as Scale only comes into effect when weapons of one technological era are used against armor of another technological era. At that point, the GM can add an arbitrary Scale difference to the weapon - or armor, whichever is of the higher tech level. No attempt to quantify tech levels is made here. This section is merely food for thought.

      In the first round, Snorri gets a Great result on his weapon skill (die roll = +1), and Brynhild gets a Fair result (die roll = -1). Snorri wins with a relative degree of +2. Snorri's damage factor of +3 is added in, bringing the damage to +5. Looking at the character sheet, a +5 result equals a Very Hurt wound - before rolling for damage.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      The GM is requiring damage rolls, so Snorri's player rolls the dice: a -2 result, too bad. This brings the damage down to 3. Since Brynhild is an NPC, the GM looks at the wound chart on her character sheet, and finds 3: a Hurt Wound. The GM marks off the box under the word "Hurt," and the next round is fought. Brynhild is now at -1 for the rest of the combat.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      In the second round, both combatants get Good results - a standoff. The GM describes it as a give-and-take of blows that are all parried or blocked as the fighters circle each other. Another five seconds have passed this round, the GM decrees.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      In the third round, Snorri gets a Great result and Brynhild only a Good result - Snorri has hit again. Since the relative degree is +1, this is a graze. The GM does allow a damage die roll on a graze, but won't let it change the result by more than one level. Snorri's damage factor of +3 normally means a Scratch on a graze.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      Snorri rolls a 0 for damage, so the GM marks off a Scratch box on Brynhild's character sheet.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      In the fourth round, Snorri decides to finish off the Hurt Brynhild in one blow: he all-out attacks, which gives him a +1 modifier to his skill, and a +1 to damage if he wins. Brynhild had decided to try for a situational advantage, though: she's spending this round in all-out defense, hoping to spot some way to get an advantage over Snorri for the fifth round. Brynhild gets a +2 modifier to her skill this turn, but can't hurt Snorri if she wins. Snorri gets a Great result, even counting his +1 for all-out attacking, and Brynhild also gets a Great result. Snorri would ordinarily have lost the combat round (all-out attackers lose tie results), but Brynhild's all-out defense means she doesn't aim any blows at Snorri, just beats his attack down.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      The GM requires a Good Perception roll from Brynhild in order to spot a situational advantage. Her Perception attribute is Great, so she easily makes it. She notices a drink on the floor, spilled earlier by a customer in full flight. Since she successfully defended that round, the GM rules she maneuvers Snorri into the slippery puddle for one round.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      In the fifth round, the GM gives Snorri a -1 to skill this round (down to Fair) for bad footing. Snorri tries an ordinary attack, and Brynhild, wounded, desperate, and sensing this may be her only chance, now tries an all-out attack: +1 modifier to her skill, bringing her up to an effective skill of Good from her wounded Fair state. Brynhild rolls a Great result, and Snorri only gets a Good result: Brynhild wins this round by +1.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      Since she was doing an all-out attack, she gets a bonus of +1 to damage. This does affect a graze, so her normal Scratch result (for a graze) is increased to Hurt. She rolls a 0 on the damage roll, so Snorri is now Hurt: -1 until healed.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      The combat is interrupted at this point by the town guards, who had been alerted by the innkeeper's son. Snorri and Brynhild are hauled off to separate cells, probably only too glad to get out of what had become a potentially deadly duel….

      Wounds are healed through a medical skill or supernormal power.

    <p class="Textbody c7">
      A Scratch is too insignificant to require a roll on a healing skill (although it might require a kiss to make it better…). Scratches are usually erased after a battle, provided the characters have five or ten minutes to attend to them. An individual GM may rule otherwise, of course: they may linger on for a day or two.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      A Good result on a healing skill heals all wounds one level (Hurt to healed, Very Hurt to Hurt, etc.). (Scratches do not count as a level for healing purposes. That is, a Hurt wound that is healed one level is fully healed.) A Great result heals all wounds two levels, and a Superb result heals three levels.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Healing with realistic medical skills takes time: the success of the roll merely insures the wounds will heal, given enough rest. How long this takes depends on the technological level of the game setting, and is up to the GM. (A day per treated wound is extremely fast healing, but may be appropriate in an epic-style game. Likewise, one minute per magically healed wound is fast.) Whether or not strenuous activity before the healing period ends reopens a wound is also left up to the GM….
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Example</span>: a character with three wounds (two Hurt results and one Very Hurt) is healed with a roll of Good. After the appropriate time, the two Hurt wounds will be fully healed, while the Very Hurt wound will now be a Hurt wound (and carries a -1 modifier as such).
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Otherwise, wounds heal on their own at one wound level per week of rest - or longer, if the GM is being more realistic. That is, after a week of rest, an Incapacitated character becomes Very Hurt, etc. The GM may also require a successful roll against a Constitution attribute: Fair Difficulty Level for Hurt, Good Difficulty Level for Very Hurt, and Great Difficulty Level for Incapacitated. Failing this roll slows the healing process. Someone Near Death should take a long time to heal, even with magical or high tech healing.

      After playing a bit, perhaps each session, a player will want the character to grow in abilities. At this point, a developing character can exceed the initial GM-set skill limits (such as one Superb, three Greats). There are two ways to handle character development, or "experience," as it's often called.

    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      When the player feels the character has accomplished enough to warrant improving in some trait (and he feels he's been role-playing well), he petitions the GM for permission to raise it. A trait can only be raised one level at a time. A trait must be used more to raise it from Good to Great than Fair to Good, and so on. It should be easier to raise a Skill than an attribute.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Or the GM can simply award an improvement in a trait she feels deserves to be raised. In these cases, there is never a corresponding reduction of another trait - this is character development, not creation.

      Attribute levels may or may not affect EPs put into skills. For simplicity, you can ignore attribute levels entirely when raising skill levels. For greater realism, however, the GM can add a surcharge of +2 EP (or more) when a skill is raised above an appropriate attribute.

    </h2>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Improving skills through EP is not always realistic, to be honest. A gaming session might only cover a few hours of campaign time. Allowing a character to improve one or two different skills from Fair to Good in that time is far-fetched. But it's fun for the players, and psychologically satisfying, and so recommended.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      As an alternative, or in addition to the methods described above, the GM may allow traits to be raised through appropriate amounts of training time. This would require finding a teacher (which would cost money) or taking an appropriate job (which may not be totally dedicated the skill you wish to learn, and so take longer). It's also possible to learn something on your own, but the GM should double the time required. If using the Objective Character Development system, the GM may (or may not) require that EPs be spent in this manner - that is, you can't spend EPs unless you also take the time to train.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The GM sets training time and costs, and difficulty of finding a teacher. The teacher has two skills that must be considered: Teaching skill, and the appropriate skill being taught. The player may need to roll the dice to see how diligently the character studied the skill. The die roll should be on an attribute such as Willpower, Drive, Zeal, Wisdom, Self Discipline, Self Motivation, Psyche, Intelligence, etc. If the player can give a valid reason why the character is extremely motivated to learn this skill, the GM may grant up to +2 to the trait tested. The GM may request a single die roll, or a roll per week, month, etc. If multiple rolls are called for, at least half of them should succeed to earn the skill improvement.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Example</span>: Billy Blaster, space cadet, is back at the Academy after his first tour of duty. He considers his Fair Laser Pistol skill to be substandard. He takes a six-week training course in Laser pistol use, taught by an instructor of Superb Laser skill and Great Teaching skill. (Since Billy has Gift: Employed by Space Patrol, this is free training for him.) The GM decides that Billy's player needs to make a Willpower roll for each two-week period to see how dedicated he is to studying. If at least two of the three rolls are Mediocre or better, Billy can raise his Laser pistol skill from Fair to Good, given the length of training and quality of the instructor. Had the training been shorter, or the instructor worse, he would have needed a preponderance of Fair or even Good rolls to have successfully raised his Laser pistol skill.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Remember that it is much easier to improve a skill from Poor to Mediocre than from Great to Superb. Require more time, or higher Difficulty Levels on the Will rolls to raise an already high skill.

      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Note:</span> <span class="c6">The following was taken from the author's "Thoughts on Fudge".</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      After a convention game one time, Ann Dupuis and I were discussing how well the game went, especially with the one newcomer to gaming at the table. The woman was not only at her first convention, but was playing her first RPGs that weekend. Fudge was the last game in her schedule that con, and she was blown away by how easy it was compared to the other games. She said she understood the character sheet without having to have anything explained to her - and that the single mechanic to resolve all actions was the best she'd seen in the five different games she'd tried.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      So we were congratulating ourselves, when I mentioned to Ann (President and Dictator for Life of Grey Ghost Games) that Fudge did have its drawbacks - experience being the most glaring. Yes, it's great for one-shot con games, but it seems to allow characters to develop too quickly or not at all in long-term games.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Ann came up with an idea which we batted around a bit, and it looks something like this:
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">Instead of awarding Experience Points, the GM awards Fudge Points at the end of a gaming session. These can be turned in for Experience Points, but the ratio in Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secfudgepoints"><span class="Internetlink">1.3.6</span></a> <span class="c6">(suggested 3 EP = 1 Fudge Point) is reversed. That is, you may turn in three Fudge Points for one EP.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">Raising traits is unchanged from Chapter</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#chapchardevel"><span class="Internetlink">5</span></a><span class="c6">.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      What this does is force the player to consider whether he needs to save his Fudge Points to get out of a jam the next session, or convert them to EP to raise a trait. He can save Fudge Points from session to session, so he can eventually swap 12 Fudge Points for 4 EP to raise a trait or two - but he may have to use some of those Fudge Points along the way to survive!
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The net effect is that character development is left totally in the hands of the player, but is slowed down from the rate suggested in the book. This means a long-term campaign becomes more viable in Fudge.

      The GM should translate at least one of her favorite characters into Fudge from whatever system she is used to. This will give her a good idea of what traits to choose, and how many.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Fudge is incredibly flexible, possibly more so than any system you've played before. Once you've translated a favorite character, fiddle with her a bit. Can you tweak her to be exactly what you want, possibly in ways your previous system wouldn't allow? What if you split that attribute into two or three effects - ah! See, she can be smart in some ways, but dumb in others; knowledgeable of some things, ignorant of others. Hmmm - too many attributes? Make some of them gifts, then - that might be easier to deal with. And so on - have fun!
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      It is easy to create NPCs to challenge the player characters by counting levels. Figure roughly how many levels have been spent on combat skills by the average player character. This figure, put into combat skills in an NPC, should give a fair fight. For example, if the PCs are built on 40 skill levels and four free attribute levels, the average character might have ten levels in combat skills directly. In that case, a gang of thugs with ten levels each of combat skills and two attribute levels put into physical attributes should challenge the player characters pretty closely.

    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      It is not practical to give guidelines for converting every game system to and from Fudge. However, two systems of trait measurement are in widespread use: a 3-18 scale, and a percentile system. While these are not used uniformly (and there are many games that don't use either system), it is still useful to discuss translating between such systems and Fudge.

      A GM can create a character template for the players. This may help a player make his first Fudge character, or allow players coming from a game with a character class system to feel at home. She should also allow custom-designed characters, though, for players who feel limited by character classes.

The GM can hand out character sheets with attributes and limits already printed on them. This can be accompanied by a copy of the list of sample skills on page, and possibly the sample lists of gifts and faults in Sections</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secgifts"><span class="Internetlink">1.3.3</span></a><span class="c6">, Gifts, and</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secfaults"><span class="Internetlink">1.3.4</span></a><span class="c6">, Faults. The players can then create characters with a minimum of hassle.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      For more detail, the GM can actually create templates of character "classes." As an example familiar to many gamer, the GM may have guidelines for players wishing to play a fantasy fighter character, or magician, or cleric, or thief, etc. The GM can set up minimum attribute standards for each character class, recommended gifts, and minimum skill levels.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Templates can be set up for any genre, not just fantasy. You may have guidelines for a typical scientist character, or policeman, or psychic phenomenon investigator, or King's Musketeer, etc.

      A character sheet can be any scrap paper, of course. However, it's handy to include the Trait Level progression and GM starting limits, if any, such as 1 Superb skill, 3 Great skills, magic available, etc.

      The following characters are designed to different GM standards to show some of the many possibilities. Each character example includes the GM guidelines used. All but the last one are made with the Objective Character Creation system, though all are compatible with the Subjective Character Creation system, of course. Easy and hard skills are denoted as such. (In the Objective Character Creation system, it costs less to get an easy skill at a given level, and more for a hard skill.) Skills that have defaults of non-existent and cost one level just to get at Terrible are listed as: Telepathy (VH). These are usually skills that control Supernormal Powers.

    <p class="Textbody">
      The numbers in parentheses after trait levels are the Objective level costs, and are optional on any given character sheet (but make it easy to tally).

      Some characters have a separate Damage Capacity attribute; others have Damage Capacity represented by some other attribute, such as Strength, Health, Body, Constitution, Physical, etc.

      Most of the gifts and faults were chosen with an eye towards variety, for purposes of example. Of course, if you use these characters, feel free to change any of the traits.

    </h4>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      The erlesti are a non-humanoid race from the star system Aldebaran. An erlest resembles a collection of animated twine and moss-covered rock. It digests the moss through its "skin" - but to a human observer, the moss appears to be digesting the erlest. Erlesti can also use the "twine" pieces as straws to drink fluids - alcohol affects them as it does humans. While erlesti have nothing resembling hands, they have strong psi powers that enable them to manipulate their environment and even travel space.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Erlesti are friendly with humanity - "interesting auras," they say, "always interesting." In general, they are bewildered by red tape, dislike war, value their families above all things, and like comfort, but don't seek extreme wealth.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Their Damage Capacity is determined by their Size attribute (their small size and increased density balance out to the same Scale as humans); Perception is determined by Empathy Skill, which they say extends to inanimate objects, and refuse to use any other word to describe the ability. Psi attributes rate raw strength; psi skills fine manipulation of that strength. Erlesti are hermaphroditic (they exchange "twine" with each other to procreate), so Seihook is both male and female.

      For a loose and easy game, the GM can assign each character class levels for the broad skill example groups listed on page. This makes an ideal game for teaching role-playing to beginning players, or when playing with large numbers of players.

    <p class="Textbody c7">
      For example, the GM decides the players can be one of seven different character classes: Fighter, Ranger, Rogue, Magician, Cleric, Diplomat/Scholar, Jack of All Trades. Each of these characters can be defined as follows:

      These character classes are merely examples for a simple fantasy game. The GM can change or ignore any that she wishes and create new character classes. She can also create classes for other genres, such as for a science fiction setting.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Each character class has unlisted Knowledge skills appropriate to its class. For example, a fighter has Good Knowledge of tactics, determining weapon quality, judging how well-trained an army is by observing it for a while, etc. Likewise, a rogue has Good Knowledge of types of locks, how many guards a wealthy merchant might have, the value of a given material for disguising oneself, etc.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Some skills listed on page &nbsp;as being under one heading fall under another in certain cases. For example, a rogue would be Great at climbing, even though Climbing is listed as an Athletic skill. In this case, it's a Covert skill. The ability to move quietly is listed as a Covert skill, but a fighter would be Fair at it, and a ranger Great.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Character development in this system is handled normally. The GM must decide at some point whether to continue to use broad skill groups or to break skills down into finer divisions. Each skill must be raised separately if the GM decides to break the broad groups into finer distinctions. If the GM likes keeping the skills together as groups, then raising an entire skill group level should cost more experience points than in a system with narrowly-defined skills - perhaps as much as ten times the cost.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Cercopes (or Kerkopes) were originally a pair of brothers in early Greek mythology. By the first century BC, however, mythological writers had expanded them into their own race. It is in this later definition that they are used here.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Cercopes (singular: cercop) are a small, apish race that love to play tricks and pranks on anyone they can. Born thieves, some of them even dared to steal Heracles' weapons! When he caught them and tied them to a pole for punishment, they amused him so with their jokes and banter that he let them go. Players should not attempt to play a cercop unless they have a roguish sense of humor.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Cercopes are small humanoids with ugly, apelike faces and a prehensile tail. A cercop stands about four feet high (120 cm), but generally stoops a bit. The face is not hairy, but both sexes tend to have long sideburns that often meet under the chin - this hair does not continue to grow, but stays the same length, as monkeys' hair does. The bodies have some scant hair on the back, and the tail is furred except for the final six inches (15 cm). Arms, legs and chests have no more hair than the average human male does, and they wear clothing - with a tail hole. Their feet resemble monkeys' feet, but they cannot manipulate things well with them. They are not fond of shoes, only wearing them when attempting to disguise themselves as another race.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Cercopes stand upright most of the time, but lean forward to run, with the tail acting as a counterbalance. Their tails are strong enough to be used in combat and to aid in climbing. However, a cercop cannot do fine manipulation (such as pick a lock) with its tail. Cercopes speak their own language, and need to learn another to speak with the rest of the party.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The average cercop has a Mediocre Strength and Damage Capacity, but a Good Dexterity. Their intelligence runs the same range as humans.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Cercopes have the racial gifts of Exceptional Balance (+2 to any action requiring balance, even in difficult situations), the Ability to Land on their Feet with no harm from twice the distance a human could, and Prehensile Tail.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Their racial faults are Impulsiveness (act first, think later), Compulsive Jokers (practical and otherwise), Kleptomania, Unattractive Appearance to other races, and Bad Reputations as Thieves and Tricksters.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      They have a bonus of +1 to the following skills: Acrobatics, Move Quietly, Climbing and Fast Talk. They have a -1 penalty to use any weapon of Medium size or bigger.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The net result is that it counts as a fault to be a Cercop. Since anyone playing such a character actually gets some useful bonuses if playing a thief, the GM should be sure to enforce the faults - especially the Bad Reputation. NPCs will have a hard time trusting a cercop, usually with good reason.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      This racial template gives a strong incentive to creating a thief character. However, it is possible to make a cercop warrior or even cleric if desired. Certain faults can be "bought off." That is, a character may have a gift of Not a Kleptomaniac - but it costs one gift, which would nullify the free fault level. However, the Unattractive Appearance and Bad Reputation cannot be bought off - these are inherent prejudices in others, not in one's self.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      A cercop character could take a fault: No Tail - perhaps he lost it in battle. This would give extra levels to overcome the -1 penalty to all medium and large weapons if a character wished to be a warrior cercop, for example.

      Such a weapon is treated as a club for damage, rather than a sword (no Sharpness bonus). The GM may require a Situational roll every few combat rounds: the sword breaks on a Mediocre or worse result from parrying or being parried. And finally, some people will make fun of anyone carrying such a shoddy-looking weapon.

      When the sword was new, however, it had:

      Ordinary, every-day equipment should not be detailed out in this manner. There is no need to define a canteen, for example, as anything other than "metal, 1 quart (liter) capacity." Even for equipment that may have an impact on the game, such as weapons or thieves' tools, you do not need to have any more information than "+2 offensive damage factor" or "adds 1 to Pick Locks skill.'
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      It's best to restrict defining equipment in Fudge character terms to the truly extraordinary (such as magic items). Another use is when the equipment's powers may be used in an opposed action: in a car race, for instance, you need to know the relative speeds and handling capabilities of the vehicles as well as the skills of the drivers. A battle between spaceships is another good example.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Equipment with personality, such as sentient magic items or advanced robots, may be treated as full-fledged Fudge characters if desired.

      Here is a sample magic system, based on the following premises mentioned in Section 2.5, Magic:
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Who can cast:</span> <span class="c6">Magicians only (supernormal power needed).</span>

Voluntarily draining a level of Power can also guarantee success for one spell.</span>

    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Source of Power:</span> <span class="c6">manipulation of local area mana.</span>

    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">

    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Drawbacks:</span> <span class="c6">casting non-trivial spells is fatiguing; severe failure causes distress.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">

    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      This system is based on the conviction that a player using magic should never be blasé: there should always be some tension and excitement when a character casts a spell, or the magic has gone out of the game. Too often in a role-playing game, the player running a magician uses tried-and-true spells so regularly that spell-casting becomes mundane. Since "mundane magic" seems a contradiction in terms, Fudge Magic attempts to instill a little excitement into spell-casting.
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      There are many ways to achieve this. Fudge Magic has chosen the following limitations:
    </p>
    <ol class="c88">
      <li>
        <p class="MyList">
          The mana available for a specific spell result gradually becomes depleted in a given area. That is, casting two fireballs in a row is harder than casting one fireball and one lightning blast, for example.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="MyList">
          Magic is an untamable force; there is a skill cap for casting spells.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="MyList">
          Magic is somewhat risky to use - there are penalties for severe failure.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="c6">Options are provided to alter these limitations for GMs who dislike them. In fact, Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secspellcastingskillalternatives"><span class="Internetlink">7.1.9.3</span></a><span class="c6">, Spell-Casting Skill Alternatives, is essential for Faerie races and demigods, who have much more dependable magic powers than humans. (Unless the GM is generous, such characters would have to buy higher skill levels normally if using the Objective Character Creation system. Taking some faults to balance such Powers is in keeping with the nature of demigods and Faerie races.)</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">See Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secfantasycharacters"><span class="Internetlink">6.3.1</span></a> <span class="c6">for sample characters using Fudge Magic.</span>

      <span class="SectionNumber">7.1.1 -</span> <a target="_self" id="RefHeadingToc201192649761757" name="RefHeadingToc201192649761757"></a><a target="_self" id="secmagicpotential" name="secmagicpotential"></a>Magic Potential
    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph">
      <span class="c6">Magic Potential is a Supernormal Power. (A suggested cost in the Objective Character Creation system is two gifts for each level of Magic Potential. This can be reduced in a magic-rich campaign.) A character with at least one level of Magic Potential (usually abbreviated to Potential, sometimes simply called Power) is referred to as a "magician" in these rules - substitute your favorite word. Only magicians may cast spells. (However, see Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secmagesandnonmages"><span class="Internetlink">7.1.9.2</span></a><span class="c6">, Magicians & Non-Magicians, for other options.) Magic Potential may be taken more than once, but each level counts as a separate supernormal power.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Each level of Magic Potential must be bought as a specialization. Specializations can be suggested by the player or set by the GM. (In the latter case, she should make a list of acceptable magic specializations.) The categories can be as broad or as narrow as the GM wishes - the broader the terms, the more powerful the magicians.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Examples of specialized Potential: Alter Inanimate Material, Augury, Combat Magic, Communication Magic, Defensive Magic, Elemental Magic, Flying Magic, Healing Magic, Illusion, Information-Gathering Magic, Mind Control, Necromancy, Only Affects Living Beings, Only Affects Sentient Beings, Only Affects Technological Items, Shapeshifting, White Magic (cannot harm anyone, even indirectly), etc.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      A character may have Power levels in more than one specialization, unless the GM disallows it for some reason. Certain disciplines may have societal constraints: in most cultures, studying Necromancy is offensive and probably illegal. Mind Control, Invisibility, Teleportation, Illusion Magic, etc., might all be limited to government-approved magicians, at best. It's even possible that such magicians will be outlaws. Anything that can be used easily to commit a crime (especially assassination or thievery) will be difficult, if not impossible, to learn openly in most cultures. If a given culture allows such magic openly, it is sure to have powerful defenses against being damaged by it.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Narrow specializations should probably cost less than one supernormal power: perhaps each specialized Potential is worth one gift.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      In order to cast a spell of a given result, the magician must have at least +1 Potential specialized in that type of magic (on the character sheet, that is: he may be temporarily reduced to 0 Potential). Someone with +1 Potential: Combat Magic and +2 Potential: Information-Gathering Magic could not cast a spell to create food in the wilderness, for example.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">Failing a spell miserably causes the temporary loss of a level of Magic Potential (see Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secmagicresolution"><span class="Internetlink">7.1.5</span></a><span class="c6">, Resolution). When this happens, the magician faints for at least one combat round. He needs a Good Constitution roll to wake up (roll each round). When he comes to, the magician may function normally, even attempting to cast the same spell again - if he hasn't dropped below 0 Potential.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      If a magician has two or more types of Potential that are appropriate for the spell being cast, and a loss of Potential is called for, the GM decides which type of Potential is reduced. For example, a magician has one level of Combat Magic and two levels of Fire Magic, and fails miserably on a fireball spell. The GM could say that he has lost either his one level of Combat Magic or one of his Fire Magic levels, but not one of each.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      If a magician drops to -1 Potential in any given specialty, he immediately falls into a coma, lasting anywhere from an hour to a day (GM's decision). When he wakes, he must roll against his Constitution: on a Mediocre or worse roll, he takes a point of damage. He checks Constitution again at the end of every day he is active - a failed result means another point of damage. These wounds cannot be healed until he recharges his Magic Potential back up to level 0.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      A magician with 0 Potential may still cast spells; a magician at -1 Magic Potential, however, cannot attempt any magic spells that would involve that specialty. He may still cast spells of another specialty. For example, a magician who falls to -1 Encyclopedic Magic can no longer cast a spell that allows him to open his blank book and read a magically-appearing encyclopedia entry on a specified topic. But he can still cast spells using his Animal Empathy Magic, allowing him to call and converse with wild animals, provided that Potential is still 0 or greater. He must still make a Constitution check for every day he his active, however, to see if his -1 Encyclopedic Magic Potential is causing him wounds.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Magic Potential may be recharged only by resting for one week per level. (GMs may alter this time to taste, of course: resting for one day is sufficient for more epic campaigns.) For example, a magician falls to -1 Potential. Resting one week will bring him up to 0 Potential (and cure any wounds incurred by being active while at -1 Potential). A second week of rest will bring him up to +1 Potential.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">No character may gain Magic Potential levels beyond his starting level except through Character Development - see Chapter</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#chapchardevel"><span class="Internetlink">5</span></a><span class="c6">.</span>

      <span class="SectionNumber">7.1.2 -</span> <a target="_self" id="RefHeadingToc201212649761757" name="RefHeadingToc201212649761757"></a><a target="_self" id="secspells" name="secspells"></a>Spells
    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      When a magician wishes to cast a spell, he describes the result he has in mind. The GM assesses how powerful such an effect would be, based on how prevalent magic is in her campaign. In a low-magic campaign, even a simple spell such as levitating the jail keys to an imprisoned character would be taxing. In a high-magic campaign, however, that would be a trivial spell, and even shooting forth a flash of lightning from a fingertip wouldn't be out of the ordinary.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The potency of the spell can be modified by the magician's appropriate Power level. An "average" magician has three levels of appropriate Power when casting a given spell. (Modify this number up or down for harder or easier magic.) That is, a spell is more difficult for a magician with less than three levels of an appropriate Power. Likewise, a magician with four or more appropriate Power levels treats a spell as more trivial than it would be for an average magician.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      "Appropriate" Power does not have to be all of the same specialization so long as each Power governs the spell in question. For example, a spell to make a sword fly up and attack a foe could be governed by Flying Magic, Combat Magic, and Control Inanimate Material. If a magician had one level of each of those types of magic, the spell would be of average potency for him.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      A spell is then Trivial, Average, or Potent. (It may also be Very Trivial, or Very Potent, if the GM wishes. In fact, the players will undoubtedly propose truly awesome spells, which should be labeled as Extraordinarily Potent, or with some other impressive adjective.) The GM tells the player what the potency of a proposed spell is - any magician character would have a fairly good idea of a spell's potency.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The spell's potency determines the Difficulty level. A spell of average potency has a Fair Difficulty level, while a Potent spell has a Difficulty level of at least Good. Likewise, a Trivial spell has a Difficulty level of Mediocre or Poor.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The GM also decides the duration of the spell if it succeeds - seconds, minutes, hours, days, etc. The character may try to adjust this, subject to GM approval. For example, the magician can voluntarily take more fatigue or reduce the scope of the effect - or accept some other penalty - to lengthen the spell's duration. Rolling a higher relative degree can also mean the spell lasts longer. Some spells have permanent effects: healing (until wounded again), busting a hole in a wall (until repaired manually or by magic), teleporting to a distant place (until you come back), and so on. Of course, even these spell effects may be temporary in a given GM's world: healing only lasts a day and the wound reappears, or a hole in the wall fixes itself after a few minutes, or a teleported person automatically returns after an hour in the other location….
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The GM also needs to determine if there are any drawbacks to casting a spell. Fudge Magic assumes that spells are tiring to cast, and a magician reduces his Fatigue attribute when casting. The more potent the spell, the more the fatigue. (Fatigue is regained by resting, of course. If Fatigue goes below Terrible, the character passes out. The GM may have separate Fatigue attribute, or base it on Endurance, Constitution, Strength, etc.)
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      A GM who dislikes the idea of keeping track of fatigue can change the drawback to something else. Perhaps a magician has a limited number of spells he can cast in a day (or in an hour). In this case, he may have a Spell Point attribute, which is drained by spell casting and regained simply by the passage of time. (A trivial spell won't drain any Spell Point levels, while an average spell drops a magician from Good Spell Points to Fair, for example, and more potent spells drain two or more levels at a time.) Draining spell points would not necessarily make the magician tired in this case, and Spell Points would regenerate whether the magician was resting or not - or they might only regenerate with sleep.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Or maybe each spell affects a magician's Sanity attribute, and he needs to convalesce to restore it. Or, equally entertaining, a spell might affect the sanity of anyone who witnesses magic! Reduced sanity can manifest in many amusing ways….

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Mana is an energy source capable of manipulating matter, time and space. It can be tapped only by those with Magic Potential.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The GM determines the availability and density of mana in a given game world, just as she does the average potency of a spell. Mana density can affect two things: how large an area is needed to fuel a given spell effect, and (optionally), how easy or hard it is to cast a spell.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      When a spell of a particular effect is cast, the magician draws a specific type of mana to him to create the effect. The next time this same effect is desired, it will be harder to do: he has drained some of that mana type in the local area.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The size of the area is defined by the GM. For most fantasy worlds, assume it's about 50 yards or meters in diameter. In a low-level magic campaign, the area is the size of a town or even city. (This would give meaning to the old line, "This town ain't big enough for both of us" - dueling wizards!) On the other hand, a high-level magic campaign is so mana-rich that the magician can simply take a step or two and be in a new area. Note that the area governs which spells can be cast without penalty: if one magician casts a healing spell, a second magician will be at -1 to cast a healing spell in the same area within the next 24 hours. (Mana may recharge at a different rate in a given game world, of course.) Note also that a magician may be unaware of what spells were cast in an area before he arrived….
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      In a mana-rich area, spells may also be easier to cast: +1 or +2 to skill level. Likewise, in a mana-poor area, spells can be harder to cast: -1 or more. The GM decides if this rule is in effect.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Mana is dispersed and weak in a world such as modern Earth. The average fantasy game world will have much stronger mana, and some high-magic campaigns will simply reek of mana. In any given world, it is possible to vary the amount of mana. Some lands may be mana-rich, while neighboring areas are mana-poor. Mana may flow in currents, or in tides with the phases of the moon. There may be "rogue" mana streams that change course and invade new areas, or a mana drought may afflict a given locale. Astrological alignments can affect mana, too - thus even here on mana-poor Earth there will be places and times of the year when cultists gather to call forth unseen powers….
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      A PC magician would know the general mana level for at least his home area. He may or may not know whether it fluctuates periodically, or if far lands have different mana levels. In order to determine the mana level of the local area at a given time, a magician must cast a spell specifically to that end.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Each spell is then resolved as an Unopposed action: the Difficulty level is dependent on the spell potency. Spells of average potency have a Difficulty level of Fair, while more trivial spells have difficulty levels of Mediocre or Poor. (No spell has a Difficulty level of Terrible - magic just doesn't work at that level.) More potent spells have Difficulty levels of Good to Superb, or even beyond Superb if a truly powerful effect is desired.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      If the magician surpasses the Difficulty level, the spell occurs as he described it. The better the relative degree, the better the result. The magician suffers -1 (or more) to his Fatigue attribute if the GM deems the spell is fatiguing. (If the GM has chosen some other drawback, of course, apply that instead.)
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Sometimes a skill roll is then needed to do something with the end result of a spell. For example, a fireball needs to be thrown accurately: use the Throwing Skill and Ranged Weapon rules in Chapter 4.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      If the magician equals the Difficulty level, then a watered-down version of the spell occurs. Either it will have a short duration, or reduced potency, or there is a time lag before the spell takes effect, etc. There may be an unexpected side effect, though it won't be harmful to the magician. There is no penalty for the magician beyond a possible -1 or -2 to Fatigue, at worst.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      If the magician rolls below the Difficulty level, however, he is adversely affected. The energy inherent in mana lashes out at the magician's psyche instead of being focused as desired. There may (or may not) be some visible magical effect, but it will not be the desired effect, and, if he rolled poorly enough, it may even be inimical to the magician's goals - or health….
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      On a failed roll, the magician is stunned for one combat round (no actions or defense) and takes at least -1 Fatigue. A Terrible result always fails.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">If he rolls a result of -4, the spell automatically fails (no matter what the resulting level) and he also temporarily drains one level of his Magic Potential - see Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secmagicpotential"><span class="Internetlink">7.1.1</span></a><span class="c6">, Magic Potential, for effects.

      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Examples</span>: Barney casts a spell, Create Pizza, of Average potency in a normal mana area and gets -3: a Terrible result. The spell fails and Barney is stunned for a combat round, but he does not drain a level of Magic Potential because he did not roll a -4. Later, in a mana-rich area (+1 to cast), Barney takes a long time (+1) to cast Detect Food, a very Trivial spell (Poor result or better needed for success). He has temporarily raised his skill to Great, the maximum allowed. He rolls a -4 result, which is a Poor rolled result. Although the rolled degree is good enough to cast the spell, Barney still fails because he rolled a -4 result. Barney not only doesn't detect any food, he also exhausts one level of Magic Potential - ouch!

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      If the spell is one which attempts to Control another being - either mentally, physically or spiritually - Opposed action rolls are also called for. First, the magician casts the spell (as above); then he has to overcome the Personal Magic Resistance of the subject. Magic Resistance may be an attribute or gift (Willpower is a good choice, if there is no specific anti-magic trait), as the GM desires. Magic Resistance may even be a different attribute for different types of spells (a mental attribute for attempts to control the mind, etc.). Note that this second roll is Opposed - the subject of the spell gets a chance to resist it, and so can influence the result.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      If the GM is willing, the magician may use the result he just rolled as his skill level for the Opposed action. That is, if he rolled a Great result on the spell, he rolls the Opposed action as if his skill were Great. Otherwise, he uses the same level he rolled initially against.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      "Control" can mean many things to different GMs. Personal Magic Resistance would resist an attempt to read someone's mind to one GM, but not to another. However, Magic Resistance does not resist any spell that calls or creates physical energy to lash out at another being. If the magician successfully creates lightning to blast the subject, it is not resisted by Personal Resistance; it is treated as a physical weapon.

    <p class="Firstparagraph">
      <span class="c6">Sometimes a magician desperately needs a certain result. In this case, he may opt not to roll the dice at all, and simply drain one level of Magic Potential for a guaranteed success. He takes the usual penalties for losing a level of Potential - see Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secmagicpotential"><span class="Internetlink">7.1.1</span></a><span class="c6">, Magic Potential. This means he'll faint - be unconscious - after casting the spell, which limits the utility for certain spells. You can't control someone's mind when you are unconscious, for example….</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The GM may restrict this to Trivial spells, or non-Potent spells, or have no restrictions at all, beyond requiring the normal fatigue (or other) penalties. If the spell is one that could logically be resisted by the subject, however, the subject still gets a Resistance roll. In this case, the magician rolls as if his skill were Great.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Items may be permanently enchanted in this system. The magician works for a number of weeks or months (as required by the GM), depending on the number and potency of the spells desired, and the general availability of magic items in the campaign. At the end of each month (or week), the magician rolls against two skills: Spell-casting, and the appropriate Craft skill for the material being worked. The usual penalties apply on failing a spell roll. If he surpasses the Difficulty level on each roll, the spell is slowly being set into the item, one stage at a time. On a roll that only matches the Difficulty level, the work counts as only half a time period, but does progress the enchantment.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Obviously, a mana-rich area will attract magicians, especially enchanters.

    <p class="Firstparagraph">
      <span class="c6">The GM may allow non-magicians to cast spells. In this case, it is risky, as there is no Magic Potential "cushion" - one severe failure is enough to devastate the character. Still, in an emergency, it may be worth the risk. Such a character would still need to have some Spell-casting skill, however. (But see Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secspellcastingskillalternatives"><span class="Internetlink">7.1.9.3</span></a><span class="c6">, Spell-casting Skill Alternatives).</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      As a substitute for Magic Potential specialization, the GM looks over the character sheet (checking traits, personality, and character background) and decides if a proposed spell would be appropriate for the character. The character must have some aptitude in the proposed spell subject, or he may not cast such a spell. For example, a trained fighter with no knowledge of book learning or foreign languages could conceivably try a combat spell, but not a spell to translate a book written in an unknown script.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Of course, the same spell is of greater potency for a non-magician than for a magician. This probably means that a non-magician will only have a chance of casting a spell that a magician would consider trivial.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Divine Favor is a supernormal power that can be taken more than once. Each time Divine Favor is taken, it is dedicated to a single deity. It is possible to have Divine Favor from more than one deity in a polytheistic world, or you can have multiple steps of Divine Favor from a single deity. Each step of Divine Favor counts as two supernormal powers (recommended).
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Divine Favor can be temporarily lost if the character does not act in accordance with the deity's desires. Usually a period of atonement is required to regain Divine Favor. This may be instantaneous for a merciful deity, or it may take up to a month for stricter deities. All steps are lost and regained as a unit when this happens.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      A character may petition a miracle at any time. However, some deities do not like to be disturbed for trivial matters, and may ignore requests when it is obvious the character hasn't even tried to help himself.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      In Fudge Miracles, the petition should be fairly precisely worded. Rather than a simple, "Please help me," the character should focus the plea: "We are starving, please feed us," or, "My friend is dying, please heal him." A holy character can petition for any miraculous result desired, however - there is no established list of miracles.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Characters without Divine Favor have a Petitioning skill of Poor (or Mediocre in a more deity-active game). Those with one or more steps of Divine Favor have a Petitioning skill of Fair. Petitioning skill cannot be raised. (In a high-level deity-active campaign, Petitioning skill can be raised to Good at the cost of one supernormal power.) Petitioning skill can be modified, however - see the next section.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      To resolve a petition, make an Unopposed action roll against Petitioning skill. Each step of Divine Favor grants the holy character one extra chance to roll the dice in a petition to his deity.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      On a Fair or worse result, the roll is a failure. If the character has any steps of Divine Favor from the same deity, he may roll again for each step (this does not count as a separate petition). He can stop at any point - only the last result rolled counts. This means a character with two steps of Divine Favor can try one, two, or three rolls. If he gets Good, Fair, and Mediocre results, in that order, the result of the petition is Mediocre.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      On a Fair or Mediocre result, the petition isn't answered by the deity, but the deity isn't annoyed by the petitioner. On Poor or worse result, however, the deity is angry with the character, and there will be a -1 on the next petition attempt. If the deity is evil, a miracle may actually occur, but not one the petitioner is likely to enjoy….
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      On a Good or better result, the petition is granted. The better the rolled result, the better the answer to the prayer. For example, a Good result heals one wound or wound level, while a Superb result totally heals the character. A Good result could call a wolf to defend the petitioner, while three lions might answer a Superb result. And so on.

    </h2>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Date: February, 1993 & December, 1993, By: Shawn Garbett and Steffan O'Sullivan</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      There are three types of Psi traits in this system: Powers, skills, and Psychic Reservoir. Only psionicists have Powers and the skills to activate them, but everyone has a Psychic Reservoir to resist psionic attacks.
    </p>
    <h3 id="toc171" class="c71">
      <span class="SectionNumber">7.3.1 -</span> <a target="_self" id="RefHeadingToc201552649761757" name="RefHeadingToc201552649761757"></a><a target="_self" id="secpsionicpowers" name="secpsionicpowers"></a>Psionic Powers
    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      The GM must decide how precisely to define Psi Powers. Since each Power must be bought separately, defining them broadly makes for more powerful characters.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The following chart (see next page) shows some broad groups that include more narrowly defined Psi power groups listed with them. These in turn contain even more narrowly defined powers, which a GM may use as individual Powers if desired. This list may be regrouped, expanded, some powers disallowed, a narrowly defined group made into a broad group that includes other powers, etc. The list is not intended to be comprehensive, but merely a sample.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The GM should let the players know what depth of Psi skills she is using. Each Power costs one Supernormal Power (two gifts).
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Putting one level in a Power gets it at Terrible. Powers may then be raised at the cost of two skill levels per level, if using the Objective Character Creation system. For example, raising Telekinesis Power to Poor requires two skill levels, and raising it to Mediocre would cost two more skill levels.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      If a GM envisions a psi-rich campaign, of course, the costs should be much cheaper. Allowing many free levels of Supernormal Powers is a good way to do this, but be cautious about trading them for mundane traits.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">Power levels define range, quantity or size of subject affected, etc. - see Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secpsi"><span class="Internetlink">2.7</span></a><span class="c6">, Psi. A Fair Power can do whatever the default average is for the campaign world.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">Some tasks require a minimum Power level, as set by the GM. If the character has the Power, but not at the minimum level required, he may not attempt the action unless he uses Desperation Psionics (Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secdesperationpsionics"><span class="Internetlink">7.3.5</span></a><span class="c6">). If the psi has the appropriate Power at three or more levels above the minimum required, he is at +1 for that use.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      No psionic ability can be used unless the character has the Power listed on his character sheet.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      A character may take a latent psi Power at the cost of one gift. He can't use the Power (may not take any related psi skills), but later in the campaign he may spend EP equal to another gift to awaken the Power. He would then have to learn the skills to control the Power.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      It is also possible to take some interesting faults that will limit the nature (and reduce the cost) of any Power. "Usable only in emergencies" is a common theme in fiction, for example.

    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      You cannot attempt any psionic action unless you have the specific skill to control the Power in question. Each Power must have an accompanying skill of corresponding broadness or narrowness (Control Telekinesis, Use Telepathy, Read Minds, etc.).
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The default for psionic skills is Non-existent. Raising a skill to Terrible costs one skill level, etc. Skills may be taken as high as Fair at the beginning of a game. (The GM may allow higher levels if the campaign is centered around psionic abilities.) They may be improved through normal character development, and new ones may be added if the GM is willing. The player should have a good story concerning awakening new skills, however.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Psychic Reservoir is a measure of raw psi power available. Like most attributes, Psychic Reservoir is at Fair for every character unless deliberately altered. The GM may set the default lower, and there may be a ceiling on how high Psychic Reservoir can be set.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Merely having a Psychic Reservoir attribute does not mean the character is capable of actively using psi. Other psionic Powers and skills are necessary to activate the Psychic Reservoir.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">A low Psychic Reservoir can negatively modify any active psi ability, while a high Reservoir can be tapped to increase your chances of success - see Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secpsimodifiers"><span class="Internetlink">7.3.6</span></a><span class="c6">, Psi Modifiers Summary.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      A psionicist taps his Psychic Reservoir when he uses a psychic skill. Ongoing use gradually drains a Reservoir, and short but heavy-duty use of a psi Power also drains a Reservoir, but normal brief use doesn't. However, a rolled degree of Terrible or worse on a psionic skill roll always lowers Psychic Reservoir a minimum of one level.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">A psionicist can also attempt to drain his Psychic Reservoir deliberately. This may be done to gain a bonus to a psionic skill (see Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secpsionicactions"><span class="Internetlink">7.3.4</span></a><span class="c6">, Psionic Actions), or to a Power (see Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secdesperationpsionics"><span class="Internetlink">7.3.5</span></a><span class="c6">, Desperation Psionics).</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      There is no immediate penalty for dropping a level of Psychic Reservoir, as long as it remains Terrible or higher. However, your next use of psi may be affected: there is a negative modifier for using a Psychic skill when your Psychic Reservoir is below Fair.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      If the Psychic Reservoir is drained to below Terrible, the character immediately loses consciousness. It requires a Good roll versus a Constitution attribute to regain consciousness, which may be attempted every combat round.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Even after regaining consciousness, a character with Psychic Reservoir below Terrible is in trouble. The GM may impose any type of affliction she desires on such a character until the Psychic Reservoir reaches at least Terrible. Suggested afflictions include mild insanity (hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, etc.), physical debility (drooling, shaking, twitching, etc.), attribute reductions, and negative modifiers for even non-psi actions.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      A character can regain one level of his Psychic Reservoir for each week (or day, or whatever the GM sets) of rest, up to his current maximum level.
    </p>
    <h3 id="toc174" class="c71">
      <span class="SectionNumber">7.3.4 -</span> <a target="_self" id="RefHeadingToc201612649761757" name="RefHeadingToc201612649761757"></a><a target="_self" id="secpsionicactions" name="secpsionicactions"></a>Psionic Actions
    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Two kinds of psionic action are possible, Opposed and Unopposed.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      An Opposed action is a psionic attack upon an unwilling subject. The attacker rolls against his specific psionic skill, and defender rolls against a Willpower attribute to resist. (A defender may have an appropriate psi skill to use instead, such as Mind Shield.) An example of an Opposed action would be an attempt to create fear in someone.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Unopposed psionic actions usually target inanimate objects. An Unopposed action could be as simple as examining an object psychically, or as complex as opening a dimensional door at one's feet. Telekinetically hurling an object at a foe is an Unopposed action because the object, not the foe, is the subject of the psionic skill.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      When a Psi wishes to use an ability, the player describes the result he wants to the GM. The GM then assigns a Difficulty level to the action. Even if a psi overcomes a defender's Willpower roll to resist, he must still roll the Difficulty level or higher to succeed at a task.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      There may also be a minimum Power level needed in order to attempt an action. For example, telekinetically lifting a pencil might only require a Terrible Telekinesis Power, but lifting a large book might require a Mediocre Telekinesis Power, and lifting a car might require a Superb Telekinesis Power. If the psi's Power level is three or more above the minimum needed, he gets a +1 to his skill level.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Note that mentally lifting a pencil might only require a Terrible Power level, but manipulating it to sign one's name would probably require a Superb skill result. To accurately forge another person's signature would not only require a Superb Telekinesis skill result, but also a Fair or better Forgery skill result.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">The time required to activate a psionic ability depends on the potency of the desired effect and the Power level of the character. It is set by the GM. This can range from a single combat round to hours of concentration. The individual can also vary the time concentrating (which must be uninterrupted) to speed up the results or increase the chances of success - see Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secpsimodifiers"><span class="Internetlink">7.3.6</span></a><span class="c6">, Psi Modifiers Summary.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The Psi now applies all modifiers and rolls against the Difficulty level using the appropriate skill. In an Opposed action, both parties involved make their rolls. On tie results, the status quo is maintained, whatever that may be.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      At this point, a psi (or animate target of a psionic attack) may attempt to sacrifice one or more levels of Psychic Reservoir to augment his rolled result. That is, if a psi fails in an Unopposed action, he may stress himself in an attempt to succeed. In an Opposed action, this can be considered two people locked in psionic combat, each struggling to boost their power a bit to overcome the other.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      To augment a rolled result, a Psionicist rolls against the psionic skill he just used, with current modifiers still effective. If the result is Good, he may sacrifice one level of Psychic Reservoir to give him a +1 on the result of the skill attempt. On a result of Great, he may sacrifice one or two levels, gaining +1 for each level, and on a roll of Superb or better, he may sacrifice up to three levels of Psychic Reservoir. On a result of Fair, Mediocre or Poor, there is no effect: he may not sacrifice a level of Psychic Reservoir, but there is no penalty for having tried. On a result of Terrible or worse, however, he not only drains one level of Psychic Reservoir, he also loses one level of rolled result. This can intensify any negative consequences of having failed.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      If one party of an Opposed action is successful in augmenting his rolled result, the other may then try to augment his. They may continue to trade sacrificing levels of Psychic Reservoir until one of them fails to change the result, or falls below Terrible Psychic Reservoir.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Someone defending with no psionic abilities rolls against Willpower-2 to augment his result.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Once augmenting - if any - is complete, the GM decides the duration of the effects - the better the roll, the better the results. Some effects will be permanent, such as Healing. Continuous concentration may be required to sustain other effects; this may slowly drain one's Psychic Reservoir.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">Psionic abilities are sometimes dangerous to use. A rolled degree of Terrible or worse will usually result in the exact opposite of the desired outcome, or some other entertaining backfire. In addition, the psi loses one level of Psychic Reservoir, as outlined in Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secpsychicreservoir"><span class="Internetlink">7.3.3</span></a><span class="c6">. It may also have a gruesome result: brain hemorrhage, loss of sanity, or a similar outcome. A Terrible result on an Opposed psionic action can mean the loser is now psychically open to his opponent. Such an open channel to another's psyche means that if the winner has any psychic ability at all, he can automatically draw on the loser's Psychic Reservoir to power his own abilities. The GM should determine these effects based on the situation at hand.</span>
    </p>

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Ordinarily, if the minimum Power level of a proposed psionic action is higher than the character's Power level, the psionicist may not attempt the action at all. However, if one is desperate enough, he can try it - at a great price.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      For each level of Psychic Reservoir voluntarily drained before the skill roll, a psionicist can increase his Power level by +1. Simply pushing the Power level up to match the minimum level needed is all it takes to try the skill - but he is at -2 to his skill for each level of Psychic Reservoir he drained for this attempt.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Unlike augmenting a rolled result (as described in the previous section), draining one level of Psychic Reservoir before the die roll is automatically successful.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      This is obviously not for casual use: the risk of a Terrible outcome is much higher than normal, as well as the guaranteed drain on Psychic Reservoir. Nonetheless, if one were being attacked by the Spawn of The Other, a demon of tremendous power, one might try anything to survive.

    <p class="Quotations">
      Yardmower Man wants to mow the lawn psionically - he needs the practice. He currently has a Good Psychic Reservoir and an interesting assortment of psi Powers and skills. The GM decides that to move and control the yard mower is a Great Difficulty level task on Telekinesis skill. It requires only Mediocre Telekinesis Power, however. Yardmower Man has a Good Telekinesis Power but only Fair Telekinesis skill. It may be tough to do it well, but he's willing to try it.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      Yardmower Man declares he's going to spend twice as much time concentrating (+1) and is also under the influence of Batch-5, a psi-enhancing drug (+1). He rolls a -1 result, which means a Good Telekinesis effort due to his modifiers. He just missed the Difficulty level. Since his power is adequate to move the lawn mower, he still mows the lawn telekinetically, but doesn't do a very good job. In fact, it looks sloppy: there are thin strips of unmowed grass here and there, and he took out half of his daisy bed with one poorly aimed swipe.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      Since this is a continued use, the GM decides that for each hour spent mowing he reduces his Psychic Reservoir by one level. It takes him two hours.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      The next day, Yardmower Man decides the director of the local government psionic research facility should be Molecularly Rearranged. (He's always snooping around, and has been known to lock up psis in the past.) The GM rules that Molecularly Rearranging a human other than the Psi himself is a Superb Difficulty level task against the Shapeshift skill, and requires at least a Great Shapeshift Power. It is also a taxing thing to do: it will drain one level of Psychic Reservoir at the end of the action. It will be opposed by the director's Presence attribute, which is as close as this campaign comes to willpower.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      Fortunately for Yardmower man, he has the Shapeshift Power and skill both at Superb level. He also consumes a double dose of Batch-5, giving him a +2 in the Opposed action, but severely risking side effects. His Psychic Reservoir is down to Mediocre from activities the night before (-1 to skill). Yardmower man rolls a -1 Result. This is modified -1 for low Psychic Reservoir, and +2 for Batch-5, giving him a Superb Result.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      The poor director has a Good Presence and Fair Psychic Reservoir. He gets lucky and rolls a Great Presence result trying to resist the psionic attack. But Great is not good enough (Yardmower man got a Superb result), so he tries to augment his result by sacrificing a level of Psychic Reservoir to fight the rearrangement of his molecules. His sacrifice roll (against Presence) is a Good Result, so he increases his result to Superb. He's still holding on, but just barely. Also, his Reservoir will be Mediocre after this round of psychic combat.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      Yardmower Man, not to be outdone, attempts to sacrifice his own Psychic Reservoir. He started the combat with a Mediocre Psychic Reservoir and full of Batch-5, so he still applies the +1 overall modifier to his Superb Shapeshift skill on his augmentation roll. He easily achieves a Good Result, and he therefore augments his result to Superb+1. (After this round, his Reservoir will also drop another level.)
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      The director desperately tries to augment his result again, but rolls a Fair result: he's reached the limit of his ability to stave off defeat. Yardmower Man rearranges the director into a lovely bush, and stares blankly at the outcome. At this point, his Psychic Reservoir drops one more level, as required by the GM for such a taxing action.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      Since he lost one level of Psychic Reservoir augmenting his skill, and another for the difficult Shapeshift action, Yardmower Man is now left with a Terrible Psychic Reservoir; he'd better not try anything this difficult for a while. Also, the GM demands a Good Difficulty level roll against Constitution to avoid any unpleasant side effects from the Batch-5 overdose. Yardmower Man gets a Mediocre result, missing by two levels. The GM smiles at the player, and secretly jots down that the next time he uses Batch-5, he'll hallucinate that the director has returned to human form and is out to get him….
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      Yardmower Man may someday drain his Psychic Reservoir fighting someone that isn't there.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Date: December, 1992, By: Ed Heil</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Instead of creating characters before starting the game, create them as the game progresses.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The GM assigns a number of skill levels available to a PC during a session. This should be based on how finely the GM defines skills: about 10 to 15 for broad skill-group games, and maybe twice that for fine skill-group games. These may be traded at the regular rate of 3 skill levels = 1 attribute level, or 6 skill levels = 1 gift. Faults may also be taken, subject to GM approval.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The players start with most of the character sheets blank - simply write out a brief sentence or two describing the character in a general way. ("Jeb is a surly dwarf, a good fighter, who is out to make a name for himself as a mean customer - and pick up some loot on the way. He likes to talk tough, and doesn't care much for halflings.")
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      As the character is confronted with challenging situations, the player must decide the level of the trait in question. For example, the PCs are confronted with a ruined castle to explore, and all the players state their characters are looking for hidden passageways. At this point, each player must set his PC's skill in finding hidden passageways (however the GM defines such a trait: Perception attribute, or Find Hidden skill, or Architecture skill, etc.). Those who are not yet willing to set such a trait must stop searching: if you use a trait, you must define it.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Since setting an initial skill at Fair level uses up two skill levels, and setting it at Superb uses up five levels, one must carefully weigh spending levels on skills as they are used versus saving them for emergency situations.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      As usual, attributes are considered Fair unless altered, and most skills default to Poor. Taking a trait at a level below the default adds to your available skill level pool, of course. However, you may only define a trait as it is used in a game situation.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">Experience points are given out as usual, but EP awarded are reduced by any unused skill levels after each session. That is, if you have two levels left after the first session, and the GM awards you three EP, you only get one more level for the next session, since you already have two levels unused. EP, in this case, can be used either to raise existing skills, as discussed in Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secobjectivedevel"><span class="Internetlink">5.2</span></a><span class="c6">, Objective Character Development, or they can be used to add new skills, as discussed in this section, above.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Note that it costs more EPs to raise an existing skill than it does to define a previously undefined skill in this on-the-fly system. EP should be slightly higher under this system than a regular character creation system, perhaps a range of up to ten per session.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Date: May, 1995, By: Reimer Behrends</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      This section handles ways of resolving conflicts without resorting to the use of dice. There are reasons to do away with dice: some people find dice mechanics too intrusive for play; others may want to get rid of randomness altogether.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      However, diceless action resolution is ill-suited to simulation-based gaming, despite the fact that the game can (and should) feel just as real as one with dice. Also, diceless resolution is usually more demanding of the GM than rolling dice to select an outcome. Even more so as there is no hard-and-fast rule for resolving conflicts without dice; instead, some creativity is required of the GM to fill in certain blanks.
    </p>
    <h4 id="toc181" class="c245">
      <span class="SectionNumber">7.4.2.1 -</span> <a target="_self" id="RefHeadingToc201752649761757" name="RefHeadingToc201752649761757"></a><a target="_self" id="secdicelessbasics" name="secdicelessbasics"></a>Basics
    </h4>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      The basic idea behind diceless action resolution is simple: the GM decides upon an appropriate outcome, based on player input and the situation at hand. The details of this, however, can be more complicated.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The idea is to use cause and effect to convey the feeling that whatever happens to the characters is not due to whim, but occurs because of the logic of the situation and the relevant history of everyone involved. It is important that any event (with exceptions, of course) appears to a be a logical effect of the preceding events. There is usually not a single event that is the outcome. The GM has to choose between several possible outcomes - which may vary wildly in terms of success and failure.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Consequently, the two most important parts in resolving an action are the reasons for a particular outcome and the consequences of that outcome.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Reasons are numerous. Foremost among reasons for success and/or failure is of course effective skill. However, a game where a sufficiently skilled character always wins and an incompetent character always fails would be quite boring due to its predictability. So we have to diversify these results, but in a way that doesn't feel artificial.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      We do this by accounting for other factors besides effective skill. These factors can involve the environment (slipping in a puddle), equipment (a gun that jams at a critical moment), time constraints (defusing a bomb before it goes off), NPC actions (a character stepping in the way), etc. The idea is not to account for all possible factors, just to find one or two reasons that make the outcome seem logical.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Detailed description is essential to diceless action resolution - description not only of the environment, but also of the characters. Noting that a character has a Great fencing skill may often suffice, but it is better to add some details (ideally through a character history). Describe style, weaknesses, and strengths, even though they may normally not show up on the character sheet. The same is true for the description of important actions.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Sometimes a character's perception (or lack thereof) may result in failure to notice why something happened. If, for instance, the floor suddenly gives way beneath him, he may not be certain as to what caused this to happen: did he step on a trap, or was there an outside agent involved? In this case, the GM will hide some or all of the reasons.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      In addition to reasons, we have to consider consequences: what impact does a particular outcome have on the situation as a whole? The more serious the outcome, the more the reasons for it happening need to be convincing.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      As an extreme example, death of player characters should only occur with ample forewarning of the risks or with really compelling reasons. Of course, jumping off a skyscraper will most likely render a character dead the instant he hits the ground. This is acceptable, because the players understand the logic of the situation. But slipping on a wet rock while crossing a stream - which can be ascribed to just plain bad luck - shouldn't kill a character outright. While it's true that slipping on a wet rock probably happens more often than jumping off a building, the GM needs to be careful in deciding the consequences of such an action.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      There are many possible results for typical actions. So, lacking clear ideas as to which one is most appropriate - maybe even torn between clear success and catastrophic failure - how can this selection be narrowed down?
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      There are a few ways to approach the problem, and it is a good idea to reach an agreement with the group before play commences as to what factors will be used. The following list is far from complete, but gives some possibilities:
    </p>
    <ol class="c88">
      <li>
        <p class="MyList c87">
          Realism: A master archer will hit the target most of the time. But sometimes even he will fail, or even have a streak of bad luck. This is important for maintaining a feeling of realism in the long run. It should also be noted that realism is relative to genre. Chandelier-swinging is likely to succeed in a swashbuckling romp, while it is at best a risky endeavour in a gritty game.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="MyList c87">
          Drama: Sometimes certain outcomes are dramatically more appropriate than others. This unfortunately depends to a great degree upon individual gaming style and can only be handled briefly here.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="MyList c87">
          Characterization: Sometimes, a character's success or failure at a particular task can help to reinforce or develop his character story.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="MyList c87">
          Theme: By assigning a certain" theme" to each scene in the game as it is encountered, actions can be resolved in a way that emphasizes that theme. An example:
        </p>
        <p class="Quotations">
          <span class="Emphasis">[The theme is "Combat is dangerous"]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="Quotations">
          <span class="Emphasis">GM: "Suddenly, you hear a rustling in the underbrush, and then, out of it, a boar emerges, charging at you."</span>
        </p>
        <p class="Quotations">
          <span class="Emphasis">Player: "I'm not armed! I'll jump for the branch of the oak next to me and pull myself up to safety."</span>
        </p>
        <p class="Quotations">
          <span class="Emphasis">[While the avoidance of a fight supports the theme, "Combat is dangerous," there are other possibilities that emphasize it better.]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="Quotations">
          <span class="Emphasis">GM: "You get hold of the branch, but as you start to pull yourself up, you hear a loud CRACK, and all of a sudden the ground rushes upwards to meet you."</span>
        </p>
        <p class="Quotations">
          <span class="Emphasis">[The situation is now much more dangerous. However, with a bit of luck and the help of the other characters in the group it is still possible to handle it without killing the PC.]</span>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="Textbody">
      All of the above factors are meta-game issues. This is intentional. These factors contribute towards an interesting game, and one of the points of role-playing is to have an interesting game. Besides, we are already using the in-game factors as cause and effect to convey a natural flow of events so we have to resort to the meta-level here.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      It may look as though there is a lot of arbitrariness on the part of the GM. This is correct to some extent. Some individual decisions will be arbitrary. In the long run it should balance out, especially if the players possess even the slightest creativity. Note also that the GM should always respect player input. If something is going to fail that should normally work, failure should still reflect player input. (For instance, the example above with the breaking branch, where the character technically succeeds, but the branch does not cooperate).

    </h4>
    <p class="Firstparagraph">
      <span class="c6">There is no need to encumber the GM with all the decisions. The easiest way to hand some power back to the players is to give them a (limited) voice in the decision making process. For this purpose we employ Fudge Points (see Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secfudgepoints"><span class="Internetlink">1.3.6</span></a><span class="c6">).</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      By spending one Fudge Point, the player (instead of the GM) can decide the outcome of an action his character is involved in, provided the action is possible and not abusive to the game. (Blowing up an entire building with a cup of gunpowder is implausible, and possibly abusive to the plot). If the action is far beyond the normal skill of the character (given the circumstances), the GM may require expenditure of two or three Fudge Points instead.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Notice that using Fudge Points also gives the GM more leeway; she need no longer worry too much whether letting a character fail is too harsh, as it is within the power of the player to help his character if need be.
    </p>
    <h4 id="toc183" class="c245">
      <span class="SectionNumber">7.4.2.3 -</span> <a target="_self" id="RefHeadingToc201792649761757" name="RefHeadingToc201792649761757"></a><a target="_self" id="secdicelesscombat" name="secdicelesscombat"></a>Combat
    </h4>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Diceless combat is action resolution with two added complications: the high risk of character death and a considerable amount of action that needs to be synchronized.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">The synchronization part is fairly easy: as in resolution with dice, you can divide the entire combat in rounds of appropriate duration, cycling through all participating characters each round, or use story elements as suggested in Section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secstoryelements"><span class="Internetlink">4.2.1</span></a><span class="c6">.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Character death is trickier because players dislike losing their characters due to bad luck (be it because of an unlucky die roll or GM whim). The key here is to "post warning signs" before dangerous situations occur. These warnings should be subtle, such as the maniacal gleam in the opponent's eyes just before she launches a wild flurry of attacks. (Hopefully the player will say his character is on the defense, or announce some trick to counter a charge.) A description of the blood dripping from a character's wrist should warn the player that there may be a slippery puddle on the floor. In other words, prepare reasons for outcomes in advance and - most important - announce them to the players.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      If the players maintain some maneuvering space for their characters after such warnings, that should be sufficient to prevent PC death - though not necessarily PC failure.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Character death - and any other drastic result - is usually due to a series of failures, each pushing the character a step further towards the edge - but always with opportunity to find a more favorable course of action in between. Unfortunately, in some situations this entire series of failures takes no longer than a few seconds.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The details of combat interaction are now fairly easy to handle, as they are an extension of normal diceless resolution. However, particular care should be taken to describe actions fully, especially in melee combat. The statement "I attack the pirate" is infinitely less informative than saying, "I assault the pirate with all I have, even if that means taking a blow or two myself. But I have to get out of here, and that means getting by her and at least wounding her so she can't follow quickly."
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The object is to give the GM enough data to work with, such as, "I'm going to feint towards the left, and if she goes for it, I'll try to use the opening created to end this business quickly," or "Now that she's wounded, I'll play it safe, trying to wear her down." Statements like these help the GM decide how combat should be resolved much more than a simple, "I attack her."
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The key here is to be creative. Everything is possible, so everything should be considered, from a simple rugby tackle to complex tactical maneuvering.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Bloodshed is an unfortunate but largely unavoidable side effect of combat. Wounds are also important because they may become major factors in the future course of the combat. Thus, wounds must be described and their effects detailed. For example:
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      "The ball of fire explodes in the center of the room. You feel a wave of searing heat washing over you, burning your clothes away and scorching your skin. The heat gradually abates, but you still cannot see anything, as the incredible brightness that hurts your eyes is only slowly receding."
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      The player should gather from this that his character is temporarily blinded, in severe pain, needing medical attention, in a state of dishabille, and in grave danger if enemies are approaching.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      (This is of course appropriate for a high fantasy game. In a more realistic game, the character is probably charred and dead.)
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Another example, this time a sniper's bullet hitting the character's arm:
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      "Something very hot and painful pierces your left arm. It also jerks you around abruptly, making it hard to maintain balance. Worse, your arm feels totally numb and is probably fairly useless right now. The good news is that they (whoever they are) apparently missed your heart by a few inches."
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      And so on. There is no need to be too graphic in describing wounds, though. More important is the description of how the wound affects the character.
    </p>

    </h4>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Fudge is ideally suited to diceless action resolution since it's already simple and word-based. This can set the tone for the amount of description necessary for a diceless game to succeed. Once players and GM get used to diceless Fudge, they'll find themselves describing their characters and actions in ways they never thought of before - and the game can be richer and more entertaining for it.

      As a simple variation on any dice technique, allow players who roll a +4 result to roll again. If the result is positive, add it in to the +4 already rolled. If the result is negative or zero, ignore the second roll. This allows a small chance of results up to +8, which can be lifesaving in a dire situation.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Only a pitiless GM would balance this by requiring additional rolls to see how miserably a person can do on a -4 result, however.

    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Date: February, 1995, By: Peter Bonney & Steffan O'Sullivan</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      If a PC is hit, he may reduce the effect of the hit by one wound level by throwing himself heroically out of the way of (at least part of) the blow. However, this heroic evasion will put the fighter at a temporary disadvantage: -2 on the next combat round in addition to any other penalties that may be accrued. This penalty disappears in subsequent rounds, as the hero is able to recover his equilibrium after a brief flurry of wild parrying. This may be repeated, but there is an additional -1 for every turn in succession that this is used.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      For example, D'Artagnan would be hit by Milady for a Light Wound (Hurt result). He heroically evades, taking only a Scratch, but is at -2 on the following round. In this round, he would be Very Hurt, but again he heroically evades, taking instead a Hurt result. The next round he is at -4: -2 for evading this round, an additional -1 for evading two rounds in a row, and -1 for being Hurt. If he can avoid having to evade on the next round, he'll only be at -1 for being Hurt. Good luck D'Artagnan!
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      If the penalty for an heroic evasion drops a fighter's skill level to below Terrible, he may still take the evasion. But he automatically collapses: his weapon drops from his nerveless fingers and his throat is helplessly exposed to the enemy for an instant death blow if the foe is so minded. A plea for mercy may accompany such an evasion, but the opponent isn't necessarily bound to honor such a plea.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Heroic Evasion can be used for major NPCs, too, of course.

      Ordinary playing cards can be used to keep track of wounds. Give a player one face-down card when his character is Hurt, and another face-down card when his character is Very Hurt. He gets rid of them when the character is healed. Face-up cards represent fatigue - the character is reeling from exhaustion. He gets rid of those by resting. (A character becomes fatigued by physical or mental activity, work, stress, etc. Casting spells, using psi powers, etc., may or may not count as fatiguing mental activity.)
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Each card the character has represents a -1 to traits that would logically be affected until the third, which represents incapacitation.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The cards may also describe hit location, if desired: a black card is the torso, while a red card means an extremity. The lower the red card, the lower the extremity; the higher the red card, the higher the wound on the body.

      Five-point Fudge is an alternative character creation system by Steffan O'Sullivan. It's used here as a basis for a sample Fudge fantasy role-playing game.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Five-point Fudge is suitable for any genre, but each genre requires customized skill lists, gifts, faults, and attributes. The version presented here is for a Fantasy genre only. These lists should not be considered as canon - everything in Fudge is fully customizable, and these lists are offered only as an easy introduction to Fudge.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Fudge itself makes no mention of "character points," using the word "levels" instead. The Five Point Fudge system of character creation introduces character creation points, which are different from levels.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Fantasy Fudge is an example of one way a Gamemaster may decide to customize Fudge to a fantasy campaign world. The game design choices made in Fantasy Fudge shouldn't be considered the "best" way to play Fudge in a fantasy game, as players' and GMs' tastes vary.

      You may use the sample Fudge character sheet in the Miscellaneous Charts and Information at the end of this document to record your character's traits. With the Skills list, you should record the number of points you spend in which skill groups (see <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secfftipsonpointspending">8.1.1.3</a> - Tips on Point Spending). For example:
    </p>

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      The Five Point Fudge system of character creation organizes skills into skill "groups" to help players decide which skills are best for the characters they wish to create. There are eight skill groups in Fantasy Fudge: Athletic; Combat; Covert; Knowledge; Magic; Professional; Scouting; and Social (see <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secfftheskillgroups">8.1.1.8</a> - The Skill Groups).
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Fantasy Fudge recommends that players be granted 5 points to purchase skills from these various skill groups. If you wish beginning characters to be more or less powerful than those presented here, please see Campaign Power Levels in the full version of Five Point Fudge, online at.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      A player can spend his points in any of the groups that he chooses, up to four points in any one group. (He must spend points in at least two groups.) Each quantity of points spent provides a certain number of skills (of the player's choice) from the appropriate group, at the levels shown below.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Because a character with too few skills may be weak in a given campaign, the GM may limit the number of points you can spend on narrowly focused skill groups. (Suggested limit: two points, either 1 in each of 2 Groups or 2 "narrow focus" points in a single Skill Group.)
    </p>

    </h4>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Examples of point expenditure: if a player wishes his character to be a dabbler at Combat, he could spend one point on the Combat group. Using a broad focus, he could then choose any three Combat skills at Fair and any one at Mediocre. Using a narrow focus, he may choose any two Combat skills: one at Good and one at Mediocre.

    </h4>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      If a player spends two points in a skill group, he can choose two skills at Good, and four more at Fair (using a broad focus), or one at Great, one at Good, and one at Fair (using a narrow focus).

    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      The more points a player spends in a given skill group, the more his character gains both familiarity with a number of skills and greater expertise in some of those skills. For example, a Combat specialist is a professional soldier who will be an expert with a few weapons, but will have also used many other weapons over the course of his career.
    </p>
    <h4 id="toc193" class="c245">

    </h4>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      The player may choose any skills within a given skill group, up to the number listed for the points spent. The player may decide which of those skills are at the listed levels. If the GM doesn't want a character to know a given skill, she should make sure the player understands this before character creation.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Thus there are thousands of player character types available in this system, yet all are easily customized to the player's desires. If you want your character to be a Jack of All Trades, don't spend more than two points in any skill group. If you want a specialist, spend at least three points in a skill group.

    </h4>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      During character creation you may trade one skill for two skills of lesser value. Thus you could trade one Good skill for two Fair skills, or one Great skill for two Good skills. For example, spending two points in a skill group normally gets you 2 Good and 4 Fair skills. You could instead choose 2 Good, 3 Fair, and 2 Mediocre skills.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Skills involved in the trade must all be from the same skill group. Exception: with a General Skills point (see above), you can trade a Fair for two Mediocre skills from two different groups. Thus a character could take six Mediocre skills from six different groups with a General Skills point.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      No other trading of skill levels is allowed, unless using the expanded trading option in Campaign Power Levels (see the full version of Five-point Fudge online).

    </h4>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      The Gamemaster may customize skill points and character creation as desired. If narrowly focused points seem too costly (giving up half the skills of a broadly focused point for an increase of one level in one skill), add another skill at Fair. Do skill levels seem too low for your epic campaign? After they've created their characters, let your players raise five skills of their choosing one level each (subject to your approval).

    </h4>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      There are many ways to create a character. If you have a concept in mind, scan the skill lists that seem most likely to fit your character. A fighter will obviously need to spend some points in Combat skills, and a thief in Covert skills.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Since you must spend points in at least two skill groups, try to think of what other skills would be helpful - or perhaps simply fun - for your character to have.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Once you've decided which skill groups to choose from, jot down the most appealing skills in these groups. The number of skills you want from a given group will tell you how many points you need to spend in that skill group. For example, if only two or three skills appeal to you from a group, spending 1 or 2 narrowly focused points is sufficient. If you really want eight or ten skills all from the same group, you're creating a specialist character: you'll probably have to spend three or four points in that skill group to get that many skills. (Another way to get eight or ten skills, if you don't mind low skill levels, is to use the "trading skills" option.) A Jack of All Trades character rarely spends more than two points in any one group, and is interested in skills from three or more different skill groups.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Once your skills are chosen, you can then set your attributes, Gifts, and Faults. At that point you'll easily be able to see what levels your attributes should logically be, and which Gifts and Faults would go most appropriately with your character.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      It's best to consult with the Gamemaster and the other players when creating characters. This can prevent problems with characters that are unsuited for the planned campaign, or PCs that encroach on one another's "spotlight" time because their skills and abilities compete with rather than complement those of the other characters. The Gamemaster should approve all characters before play begins.

    </h4>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Each genre has its own skill groups. Listed here are eight skill groups for a Fantasy setting. The GM may customize these lists, of course, and may even add or delete an entire skill group if desired.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Following the lists is an alphabetical list of the skills, with descriptions and which skill group they appear in.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Note:</span> although four of the skill groups have multiple titles, such as Athletic/Manual Dexterity Skills, for simplicity they are referred to outside this list by the first part of the title, such as Athletic Skills.

    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Skills marked with an asterisk (*) appear in more than one skill group. These may be learned by spending points in either skill group - there is no reason to learn the same skill from two different groups.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      There are six attributes in Fantasy Fudge. The GM may customize this list as she wishes - changing the attributes included, adding or deleting them at will.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Reasoning:</span> <span class="c6">Thinking ability; puzzle-solving; intelligence; mental acuity.</span>
    </p>

    </h4>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      All attributes start at Fair. Each character may take two free attribute levels, either raising one attribute two levels, or two attributes one level each. (The GM may allow more or fewer free attribute levels - see Campaign Power Levels in the online version of Five-point Fudge.)
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      In addition, players may trade levels - that is, lower an attribute to Mediocre in order to raise one other attribute one level, and so on. Also, subject to GM approval, a character may raise an attribute by taking an additional Fault, or by foregoing one of the two free Gifts.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Conversely, a player may forego one of his free two attribute levels in order to take an extra Gift - again, subject to GM approval.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Attributes are not linked to skills in this game. The player is encouraged to choose attribute levels which make sense, given his skill list. For example, three or more points spent between Combat, Scouting and Athletic skills means that the character would logically be above average in Strength, Agility, and/or Health. If the player decides not to raise at least one of these attributes above Fair, he should have a good story as to why they are abnormally low.

    </h4>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Attributes are used for three things in the game:
    </p>
    <ul class="c8">
      <li>
        <p class="MyList c87">
          As very broad skills. There will be times in which no particular skill listed in the rules is appropriate for the task the character is attempting. In these cases, the GM will choose the closest attribute and have the player roll versus the attribute.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="MyList c87">
          In certain opposed actions, such as attempting to sneak by a guard (Move Quietly skill vs. Perception attribute) or a swindle attempt (Con skill vs. Reasoning attribute) or an attempt to strangle someone (Strength attribute vs. Health attribute). The GM will think of other cases readily.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="MyList c87">
          As a broad handle on who the character is. A high Reasoning, low Strength character has a different flavor from the opposite attribute levels.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="toc203" class="c71">
      <span class="SectionNumber">8.1.4 -</span> <a target="_self" id="RefHeadingToc202192649761757" name="RefHeadingToc202192649761757"></a><a target="_self" id="secffgifts" name="secffgifts"></a>Gifts
    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Each character may have two Gifts from the following list, or other GM-approved Gift. In addition, for each Fault chosen beyond the first two, the character may have an additional Gift. The GM may limit the number Gifts available from this method, as things can get a little out of hand?…. You may also gain a Gift, with GM approval, by foregoing one of your free attribute levels.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Certain Gifts, marked with an asterisk (*), may be lost if abused. Contacts, Favors Due, and Patron depend on the goodwill of others, and it's possible to push them too far or too frequently.

      Innate Magic takes no study - it's a Gift you're born with. The Gamemaster may assign this as a racial gift to non-human races (such as Elves) if she wishes. All members of such a race would have the Magical Talent: Innate Gift (or a serious Fault if they don't).
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Hedge Magic and Scholarly Magic are learned techniques. Their Talents are handled differently and are not interchangeable. Not everyone has the ability to perform these types of magic - you need the Magical Talent Gift.

      Clerical Magic is actually performed by a deity through the character. You need the Divine Favor Gift to use Clerical Magic.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      This type of magic may be appropriate for Faerie races, who have an inborn talent for magic that has nothing to do with the learned magic of human magicians. It's also possible to have a human character with Innate Magic, if the GM permits.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Each Innate Magical power requires the Gift, Magical Talent: Innate. Each such Gift provides only one type of Innate Magic, taken from the list below. The GM may ban some of these talents, or create others - ask. Note that some types of Innate Magic have been listed as separate Gifts, such as Danger Sense, Empathy with Animals, etc.

    <p class="Firstparagraph">
      <span class="Emphasis"><span class="c6">Note:</span></span> <span class="c6">Hedge Magic is based on the Hedge Magic system created for</span> <span class="StrongEmphasisItalic">GURPS</span> <span class="c6">(R) by S. John Ross. (</span><span class="StrongEmphasisItalic">GURPS</span> <span class="c6">is a registered trademark of Steve Jackson Games.)</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      GURPS Hedge Magic can be found at:
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Hedge Magic is the "peasant" version of magic: hedgerow witches and village wizards concocting herbal potions, creating charms, nullifying (or, alas, casting) curses, etc.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      You may spend up to four points in the Hedge Magic group, but only as many points as you have levels of the Magic Talent: Hedge Magic Gift. That is, if you take only one level of Magic Talent: Hedge Magic Gift, you may only spend one point on Hedge Magic skills.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The skill list for Hedge Magic follows, and is treated like any other skill group. That is, one point spent in Hedge Magic allows you to choose 3 skills at Fair and 1 at Mediocre, etc. Each skill is a mundane skill found in other skill groups - if you learn it in the Hedge Magic group, there is no need to learn it from another group.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      You may use a mundane skill from this group without applying Hedge Magic. But if you use Hedge Magic, you can accomplish more than you could otherwise. Hedge Magic is not flashy magic - you'll never see major magical effects from it. It's nonetheless effective in what it tries to do.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Hedge Magic is fatiguing, however - your Health attribute drops one level, temporarily, for each use. If your Health level falls below Terrible, you are exhausted and collapse - treat as the fatigue equivalent of "Incapacitated." A level of fatigued Health is regained simply by resting 15 minutes.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Another possible downside to Hedge Magic is that the results may be perceived as magical, which, depending on the situation, may get the caster in trouble.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The following mundane skills are the only ones which may be enhanced by Hedge Magic, unless the GM permits otherwise. Those without descriptions are simply assumed to provide enhanced results.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Scholarly Magic is the "upper class" version of magic: sorcerers in towers poring over ancient tomes, wizards roaming the world seeking out spell-crafters and new sources of power, colleges of magicians teaching apprentices while debating among themselves the merits of this spell or that, etc.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">A sample Scholarly Magic system is presented below. It's a flexible magic system, with no preset spell list, and thus leaves a lot of decisions up to the GM. Gamemasters are welcome to substitute any other magic system of choice. The sourcebook A Magical Medley from Grey Ghost Games contains a chapter on creating Fudge magic systems, as well as six sample systems. The Gramarye is particularly recommended; you can also find it online at . Also recommended: Fudge Magic (see section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secfudgemagic"><span class="Internetlink">7.1</span></a> <span class="c6">of the core Fudge rules), GURPS (R) Magic, and Four-by-Five Magic ().</span>

    </h4>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Characters wishing to learn Scholarly Magic must have the Magical Talent: Scholarly Magic Gift. You may spend up to four points in the Scholarly Magic group, but only as many points as you have levels of the Magic Talent: Scholarly Magic Gift. If you spend only one Gift on Magic Talent: Scholarly Magic, you may only spend one point on Scholarly Magic skills. Note that Scholarly Magic skills cost more; see below.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Characters without Magical Talent may learn the Thaumatology Knowledge Skill instead. This will allow them to recognize magic spells, skills, and possibly magic items and talismans (especially if powerful or well known), but not cast magic themselves.

    </h4>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      The Scholarly Magic skills are difficult areas of study, covering magical incantations, rituals, arcane knowledge, and more. There is no default for these skills, so a character learning Scholarly Magic in-game (as opposed to pre-game character creation) would learn the skill at Terrible. They cost more at character creation, as well.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Note that you may trade 1 Scholarly Magic skill for 2 skills at one level lower. And remember that you can spend only as many points in Scholarly Magic as you have Gifts in Magical Talent: Scholarly Magic.

      The Gamemaster should decide which of the Scholarly Magic skills presented here are allowed. The "Black Arts" (Sorcery and Necromancy) may be restricted to NPC villains, for example. Likewise, the Scholarly Magic Skill of Alchemy may be off limits. (PCs should be allowed to take the Knowledge Skill version of Alchemy, which allows them to recognize various alchemical potions and know something about the procedures and ingredients involved in making them, but not actually create magical elixirs.)
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The GM may also decide that each culture in the game world knows only a few of the many "flavors" of Scholarly Magic. For example, Shamanism may be restricted to the "primitive" tribes on the jungle continent, or to the horse nomads on the great steppes. Another culture may know Mesmerism, but outlaw its use. A centuries-old university of mages may combine Conjuration and Kineticism into a single branch of study, and likewise with Extra Sensory Perception and Mesmerism. Perhaps Runes are a lost art, and no one living now understands the strange markings found on ancient obelisks and monuments and over archways leading to catacombs.

    </h4>
    <p class="Firstparagraph">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Alchemy:</span> <span class="c6">The art of mixing balms, draughts, elixirs, nostrums, ointments, philters, potions, powders, salves, tinctures, tonics, and more, with varying magical effects. Non-mages can have knowledge of the processes and ingredients and final products of alchemy, but are not able to create magical substances themselves; see the Alchemy (Knowledge) skill.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Magical Feats</span>: The GM can have elixirs in the game which produce any magical effect she wants. Alchemical mixtures are used up when applied; unless provided in multiple "doses," they only work once.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">In-Game Requirements</span>: Alchemical processes take a lot of time and materials to prepare. A fully equipped alchemical lab requires great wealth, which means either a high status or a patron to support them. Each alchemical concoction takes weeks or months to prepare, with a high rate of failure, and rare materials that render mass-production impractical. Player character alchemists are not likely to prepare many alchemical substances, simply because of the time and effort involved.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Restrictions</span>: The Gamemaster may require an alchemist to also have a Magic or Knowledge Skill appropriate to the alchemical effect desired. For example, a potion of healing may require skill in Herb Lore, Medicine, or First Aid - or the equivalent Hedge Magic skills, hence requiring a Magical Talent: Hedge Magic Gift as well. A philter of flying may require Kineticism (see below) or collaboration with a Kineticist.
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Artificing:</span> <span class="c6">Bestowing magical properties on items.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Magical Feats</span>: As with alchemy, the GM may allow any enchanted items she wishes in the game. There are three categories of magic items: charms and talismans, with long-lasting but subtle magic; "One-shot" items such as scrolls that release their magical effect all at once (some may be enchanted to work more than once, but will stop working under pre-set conditions, or after a set number of magical feats are performed); and permanent magical items, such as magical swords, cloaks of flying, and the like. "Magic vessels" are permanent enchanted items that are relatively easy to create; they collect and store mana (magical power; see below) for later use, providing scholarly mages with a "magic battery" of sorts.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">In-Game Requirements</span>: As with alchemy, artificing requires lengthy rites. Even a simple talisman or charm takes several weeks to ritually prepare, although actually embuing it with magical power may require only a short ceremony and a GM-determined expenditure of mana. Powerful, permanent enchantments require the item to be specifically created and prepared with the enchantment in mind, and may require the item to be crafted out of rare or precious materials. It's not enough to take any old sword and slap an ever-sharp enchantment on it; the sword must be forged in a prescribed manner, with rituals of artificing and enchantment performed on it throughout its creation. Artificing also requires much mana, which is usually expended in several stages throughout the artificing process.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Restrictions</span>: Artificing requires the mage to also be skilled in the type of magic bestowed on the item. A wand that turns the target into a frog requires the Transmutation skill; a bag of winds requires the Elemental skill; and so on. Magical scrolls that allow the reader to cast spells require two skills; the Rune skill (for knowing the symbols to use to "write" the spell on the scroll) and the appropriate magic type skill (Mesmerism for a sleep spell, etc.). The GM may also require the artificer to be skilled in crafting the item to be enchanted. Magic swords may need an Artificer who is also a swordsmith (Smithy professional skill). If the artificer collaborates with another magician or with a skilled craftsman in creating an enchanted item, each participant must match or exceed the Difficulty Level set by the GM at each stage of the artificing in order for the final enchantment to work.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Note:</span> The ability to create magic vessels is included in the Artificing skill, as the ability to store mana in an enchanted item is at the heart of all artificing.
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Conjuration:</span> <span class="c6">Creating objects (even creatures!) out of "thin air" - or making objects disappear.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Magical Feats</span>: A conjurer can produce magical energy (in the form of heat, or light, or both) or non-magical items (such as water, air, food, or anything else the GM allows), or creatures (normal animals, magical creatures, and even sentient creatures). The Gamemaster decides whether such conjurations actually create these things, or whether they're "called" from another dimension or world. Most conjurations have a limited duration, and will disappear after a GM-set amount of time. Fairy Gold is an example; it looks and feels and tastes like real gold, but disappears when the spell has run its course.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The GM may allow conjurations to be "renewed" by expending more mana. Conjuration may also be used to banish items or creatures, including creatures and spirits called up by Elementalism, Necromancy, Shamanism, or Sorcery. Such "banishments" are resolved as an Opposed action - the Conjuration Skill versus the original skill roll that called the creatures or items into being.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">In-Game Requirements</span>: Conjurations typically have short casting times (an hour or less), but require a lot of mana (magical power) to perform.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Restrictions</span>: Conjuration creates or calls items and creatures - it doesn't control them. For a conjurer to have control over his creations, he'll need Elementalism (to control any element conjured), Kineticism (to animate items), or Mesmerism (to control conjured creatures).
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Elementalism:</span> <span class="c6">Elementalists specialize in controlling and transforming the four elements: Earth, Air, Fire, and Water.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Magical Feats</span>: Just about anything involving controlling or transforming Earth, Air, Fire, or Water can be done with Elementalism. Working with Earth, one could turn rock to dirt (or vice versa); cause (or calm!) an earthquake or rockslide; or turn a hard metal brittle. Air magic includes stirring a gentle breeze into a fiercer wind, or directing it to carry your words to a particular person's ears in a whisper spell. An Elementalist's campfire could remain bright and warm without consuming fuel; or shoot forth a spark to set some nearby flammable material alight. Water magic includes feats such as purify water and turning water to ice. Many materials have the properties of multiple elements - mud is Earth and Water; lightning is Air and Fire; a living creature is made up of all four elements; etc. The more elements a Feat involves, the more difficult it will be.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">In-Game Requirements</span>: Elemental magic is often quick to perform. Mana costs vary with the scope of the feat being performed. Parting a river to allow safe crossing will take much more mana than magically bringing a small cup of water to a boil. (Parting a river - or a larger body of water - can be done by many elementalists working in concert, or with a fabled and powerful Staff of Water Command.)
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Restrictions</span>: Creating some amount of an element (a fireball, for example) requires the Conjuration skill. Transforming one element into another requires the Transmutation skill. Calling forth an Elemental - a powerful construct imbued with the very essence of one of the four Elements - requires Shamanism or Sorcery.
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Extra Sensory Perception:</span> <span class="c6">Perceiving things with more than the usual five senses.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Magical Feats</span>: Examples of "Esper" magic include Empathy, Telepathy, Clairvoyance (seeing at a distance), Clairaudience (hearing at a distance), Astral Travel (moving out of body, or taking a soul journey to another plane), Divination, and Sensing Auras. An Esper mage also knows how to block Esper magic. Espers excel at detecting the presence or patterns of magic and mana.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">In-Game Requirements</span>: Esper magic requires concentration and focus. Typical rituals are relatively short (a matter of a few minutes), but may require a period of purification and meditation before beginning. Espers are vulnerable when experiencing out-of-body travel, and should arrange protection or safety for their physical bodies while their spirits roam.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Restrictions</span>: The information received through Esper magic is not always crystal-clear, and may be subject to misinterpretation. Any distractions, even slight ones, while the Esper is attempting extra sensory perception requires a Willpower roll to ignore (Difficulty Level equal to that set for the magical feat itself).
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Kineticism:</span> <span class="c6">The magic of motion.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Magical Feats</span>: Levitation, Telekinesis, Teleportation, Animation of objects, and magical "Force" shields or weapons are all possible.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">In-Game Requirements</span>: Most kinetic feats require concentration, especially when they involve precisely targeted movement. Mana is expended to start something in motion, and then concentration and willpower are used to direct that motion. Teleportation requires the Kineticist to be at the originating point (although he can Teleport either himself or another), and also to have recently been to the destination point. Without a clear picture of the destination in mind, a Kineticist may "miss" during a Teleportation, with potentially dire consequences such as appearing a bit too far above (or below!) ground level….
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Restrictions</span>: In the case of magical "force" weapons (such as a magic missile of harm), the GM may require the player to roll once against the character's Kineticism skill (to create the magic force) and again using either the character's Kineticism skill or Willpower attribute to direct the missile. A magical "force" shield could be accomplished as one task - the creation of a magic force that moves with the target and blocks contact with anything physically harmful. If a Kineticist wishes to animate an object but also grant it some self-direction or even intelligence, the Shamanism or Sorcery skill is required to bind a spirit to the animated object.
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Mesmerism:</span> <span class="c6">Affecting minds with magic. Mesmerism may be opposed by the Willpower attribute.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Magical Feats</span>: This skill covers Hypnosis, Illusion, Mind-Control (of humans or animals), and other mind-affecting magic. The ubiquitous "Sleep" spell falls under this skill. "Invisibility" can also be accomplished with Mesmerism. At its simplest level, Mesmerism can confuse a creature's senses. At its most insidious, it can completely enslave a creature's mind, bending it to the Mesmerist's will.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">In-Game Requirements</span>: Mesmerism works only against living creatures that also have at least a rudimentary mind. A Mesmerist must be within a certain distance of his targets to be able to affect their minds - the distance varies with the difficulty of the feat being attempted. The more complex the "confusion of the senses" being attempted, the more difficult the feat. The more creatures to be Mesmerized, the more mana is required. The same goes for intelligence, to a point. Normal animal intelligence, such as that of a dog or a horse, is the easiest for most Mesmerists. Affecting the minds of creatures that are more or less intelligent than "normal animal" requires more mana to overcome the target's intelligence (or lack thereof).
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Restrictions</span>: The GM may rule that certain non-human creatures (especially intelligent ones) simply have minds that are too "alien" for a Mesmerist to affect. Mammals will be the easiest to affect. Insects, with their tiny and differently-wired brains, are not easy at all. Any creature with a Willpower attribute may oppose Mesmerism (resolve as an opposed action, Mesmerism skill vs. target's Willpower attribute), plus any applicable modifiers.
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Necromancy:</span> <span class="c6">"Death Magic." Necromancy is a "Black Art," although not as dangerous to wield as Sorcery.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Magical Feats</span>: Creating (or destroying) and controlling undead creatures, summoning spirits of the dead for divination, and driving a spirit from a living body are all possible with Necromancy. Necromancers can also cause hauntings or release ghostly spirits to the afterlife. The most powerful Necromancers may be able to bring the dead back to life (a far more difficult feat than simply animating their corpses).
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">In-Game Requirements</span>: Necromancers require access to the raw materials typically needed for their magic - dead bodies. Most cultures frown on such uses of earthly remains.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Restrictions</span>: As Necromancy is illegal in many cultures, most Necromancers have the fault Secret (see above). The GM may require Necromancers to have the Kineticism skill to animate corpses (as zombies, skeletons, or other undead creatures), or she may substitute Shamanism as the means by which a spirit is tied to a corpse to create an undead creature. A generous GM will allow Necromancers to use their own methods to call the spirits or raise the dead. Necromancy may be restricted to non-player characters.
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Runes:</span> <span class="c6">The use of arcane symbols (runes, sigils, hieroglyphics, and other marks) to cast spells and enchant items.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Magical Feats</span>: Runes are symbols that are inherently pre-disposed to attracting mana and shaping magical power toward a desired end. Some runes are used to enhance other Scholarly Magic skills, aiding the mage's concentration (lowering the Difficulty Level of a given magical feat), tapping into or focusing magical energy (decreasing the power point cost), or delaying or modifying the effects of a magical feat (triggering the actual spell when certain circumstances are met, for example). Other runes act more like spells, with the drawing of the rune in the prescribed manner being the only ritual required to perform the magical feat associated with that rune. Most Artificers are well versed in runes, as runes are used in preparing spell scrolls and in many other magical items. Artificing can also be used to make a rune and its effects more permanent. For example, a Sigil of Warding drawn above the archway to a room would repel an intruder only once, unless applied in conjunction with the Artificing skill.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">In-Game Requirements</span>: The appropriate rune must be carefully and correctly drawn. Simple runes may be traced in the air or on the ground with a finger. More complex runes may require the mage to draw them in blood on a ritually prepared skin, or painstakingly create them in colored sands on a flat, swept surface, or perform some other equally detailed ritual to create and invoke the rune. Generally, the more complex the magical feat being attempted, the more complex or numerous the runes required, hence the more time required in applying the runes.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Restrictions</span>: Each rune or symbol has a different purpose, and the mage must know the appropriate rune for a given magical feat. The Gamemaster may create a list of runes or other symbols the mage knows, with brief descriptions of how they may be used in the game.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Note:</span> When used in conjunction with other Scholarly Magic skills, the player may roll against the Rune skill even if Runes is not the lowest skill level involved - but only if the runes involved are directly related to the magical feat.
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Shamanism:</span> <span class="c6">Spirit Magic. Shamans interact with spirits of varying powers. Spirits include ancestral spirits, anima (spirits that imbue every object; some anima are more powerful than others), and "guardian spirits."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Magical Feats</span>: A Shaman can cause any magical effect the spirits he deals with are capable of creating. Shamans can also exorcise troublesome spirits and ghosts, and even creatures (or constructs or demons) called through Conjuration, Necromancy, or Sorcery.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">In-Game Requirements</span>: Shamans don't typically need to expend much mana, as any magical feat beyond the initial contact with a spirit is performed by the spirit itself. Once contacted, a spirit may require a bribe, or bargain, or some other method of persuasion to actually perform the requested feat. Spirits must be honored, with each spirit requiring a different ritual. Dancing, sacrificing (of goods, animals, or even sentient creatures), and singing are often essential features of Shamanistic rituals.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Restrictions</span>: The Shamanism roll made when a Shaman character wishes to perform a magic feat determines whether or not the Shaman successfully contacts the desired spirit. An additional skill, such as Flatter, Intimidate, Parley/Negotiate or other persuasive means may be needed to convince the spirit to actually perform the magic feat requested of it. Shamans who fail to uphold their part of any spirit bargain tend not to be able to practice Shamanism well for long. The Gamemaster may require a Shaman to use the Extra Sensory Perception skill for communicating with the spirits through trances and out-of-body experiences. Artificing is required to create shamanistic objects (charms, talismans, and the like) imbued with spirits that perform magic for the wielder.
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Sorcery:</span> <span class="c6">The "Black Arts." Sorcery relies on summoning demons and other powerful, evil beings to trick or bribe or force them into doing the sorcerer's bidding.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Magical Feats</span>: Anything that can be done by a demon, devil, or evil spirit can be accomplished with Sorcery - provided the sorcerer is powerful enough to summon the required entity and crafty enough to convince it to do his bidding. Sorcerers may gain innate magical gifts and other magical powers, either permanently or temporarily, through their dealings with powerful evil beings.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">In-Game Requirements</span>: There are three facets to sorcerous dealings - summoning the evil being; controlling the evil being (by holding it within a circle of power, for example); and persuading it to do the summoner's bidding. The summoned being will seek to twist or distort or otherwise alter any deal struck with the sorcerer, so sorcerers must take care to protect themselves and negotiate their deals carefully.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Restrictions</span>: Penalties of failure are severe, and often gruesome. Evil beings do not take kindly to being summoned against their will, and even less kindly to forced servitude. Should a sorcerer's control slip, even for an instant, the demon or spirit will do its best to harm its captor. Few cultures welcome sorcerers, so the Secret Fault may be required. The Gamemaster may (and probably should) restrict Sorcery to non-player characters, or to PCs with specifically crafted backgrounds (such as a sorcerer-hunter who was once a practicing sorcerer himself).
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Transmutation:</span> <span class="c6">Turning things into other things. Living creatures may oppose such transformations with Willpower.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Magical Feats</span>: The more unalike the original object and the transmutated object are, the harder the feat. Turning living objects into inanimate objects (such as statues) or vice versa is especially difficult. Turning water to wine, or a glutton into a hog, are easier. Such transformations are usually of short duration; it takes much skill and power to affect a permanent transformation.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">In-Game Requirements</span>: Transmutation is a difficult art, often requiring much mana. Affecting a permanent transformation usually requires the use of a powerful enchanted item, such as a staff of transmutation or wand of frog princes.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Restrictions</span>: If the magician's target has a Willpower attribute, it may resist the magical change. Resolve as an Opposed Action, the mage's Transmutation skill versus the target's Willpower attribute, plus or minus any modifiers the GM sets.
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Wizardry:</span> <span class="c6">The "Wise Arts." The most scholarly of scholarly magic, Wizardry concerns itself with the laws of magic, the flow of mana, and the underlying structures of spells, incantations, and enchantments. Wizards know many ways to gather mana, and how to use it efficiently.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Magical Feats</span>: Wizardry can detect or analyze magic and magic items, dispel magic, alter mana flows, and perform similar feats that directly affect the forces that make magic possible. Wizardry can also lower the cost in power points of a given feat (see <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secffmana">Mana</a>, below).
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">In-Game Requirements</span>: When applying Wizardry, the Wizard must take time to consider applicable magical laws, mana flows in the area, and any circumstances present at the time of casting that could affect the outcome.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Restrictions</span>: The GM may require the player to refer to "laws of magic" (Similarity, Contagion, or whatever "laws" are appropriate for the game world), create rhyming "incantations," or otherwise embellish the description of what the mage is doing when using Wizardry in a magical feat.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      <span class="Emphasis">Note:</span> When used in conjunction with other Scholarly Magic skills, Wizardry may provide a +1 bonus to the character's skill roll. This occurs only if the character's Wizardry skill is higher than one or more of the other Scholarly Magic skills involved (see below).
    </p>
    <h4 id="toc212" class="c245">
      <span class="SectionNumber">8.2.3.4 -</span> <a target="_self" id="RefHeadingToc202372649761757" name="RefHeadingToc202372649761757"></a><a target="_self" id="secffmana" name="secffmana"></a>Magical Power (Mana)
    </h4>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      Casting scholarly magic requires mana, or power points. Truly trivial magic (with effects similar to those attainable with Hedge Magic) uses negligible amounts of mana, but most scholarly magic requires one or more power points.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Each level of the Magical Talent: Scholarly Gift grants the character 5 power points to use in performing magic.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The number of Gifts used to purchase Magical Talent also affects how much mana the character can channel and control. One Magical Talent Gift allows the character to perform trivial magic, and magical feats costing 1 power point. Two Magical Talent Gifts increase that to 2 power points, and so on.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Attempting to channel more power than the character can normally handle requires a Willpower roll, Difficulty Level equal to Fair plus 1 per power point over the character's usual limit. Thus, a character with 2 Magical Talent Gifts attempting to channel 4 power points to perform a magical feat must roll Willpower against a Difficulty Level of Great (Fair +2). Failure results in the loss of one level of Health by each level the Difficulty Level is missed. (A Mediocre result with a Great Difficulty Level would result in the loss of 3 Health levels; see <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secfffatigue">Fatigue</a>, below.)
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Power points may be regained at the rate of 1 point per 2 hours of sleep or 1 hour of undisturbed meditation, up to the number allowed by the magician's Magical Talent Gifts.
    </p>
    <h4 id="toc213" class="c245">
      <span class="SectionNumber">8.2.3.5 -</span> <a target="_self" id="RefHeadingToc202392649761757" name="RefHeadingToc202392649761757"></a><a target="_self" id="secfffatigue" name="secfffatigue"></a>Fatigue
    </h4>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      In addition to requiring mana, Scholarly Magic is fatiguing (much like Hedge Magic). The character's Health attribute drops one level for each use. If Health level falls below Terrible, the character is exhausted and collapses - treat as the fatigue equivalent of "Incapacitated." A level of fatigued Health is regained simply by resting 15 minutes.
    </p>
    <h4 id="toc214" class="c245">
      <span class="SectionNumber">8.2.3.6 -</span> <a target="_self" id="RefHeadingToc202412649761757" name="RefHeadingToc202412649761757"></a><a target="_self" id="ffperformingmagicalfeats" name="ffperformingmagicalfeats"></a>Performing Magical Feats
    </h4>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      When a character wishes to perform magic, the player should describe to the Gamemaster the magical results the character wishes to achieve. The more detail included in the description, the better. Scholarly magic depends heavily on the magician's concentration and clarity of thought, and if the player isn't paying much attention to what the character wishes to accomplish, the GM may assume the character isn't, either.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The player may also describe the magician character's actions, and aspects of the ritual being used to perform the magic feat, if desired. Including poetic incantations (especially if it's good poetry) and other "flavor" in the description of the ritual may be worth bonuses to the character's skill.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      There are several aspects that should be considered for each magical feat:
    </p>
    <ul class="c8">
      <li>
        <p class="MyList">

    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Skill:</span> <span class="c6">The more complex the desired results, the higher the Difficulty Level the GM should set for a magical feat. Difficulty Levels start at Fair for simple magic, such as creating - but not controlling - fire, or speaking with a spirit that's already "awake" and interested in communicating. Difficulty can range up to Legendary or even beyond, for god-like magical feats. Some "trivial" magic may have Difficulty Levels of Mediocre, but any magic requiring power points should be of at least Fair Difficulty.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Once the Difficulty Level is set, the player rolls against the magician's Scholarly Magic skill. Use the lowest skill if the feat requires more than one Scholarly Magic skill.
    </p>
    <p class="Quotations">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Example</span>: Enchanting a Staff of Dragon Summoning and Control requires skill in Artificing, Conjuration, and Mesmerism. An enchanter with Artificing: Mediocre, Conjuration: Fair, and Mesmerism: Good would roll on a skill level of Mediocre.
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Mana:</span> <span class="c6">The more powerful or all-encompassing the desired results, the more power points will be required. "Trivial" magic may require so little mana that power point use isn't even tracked. This doesn't mean a mage can go around popping off trivial spells all day, though, since even trivial spells requiring no power points will fatigue the mage.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Note that the Difficulty Level and the mana required are not related; one measures complexity, the other power. Creating a small colored flame that dances in a pattern that recreates an ancient battle between wizards may be of Legendary Difficulty, but require only one power point.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Note also that some magical feats require more power points than any but the most Legendary Wizards have access to. Such feats are possible, either through pooling the power points of more than one magician, or drawing on "mana vessels" containing stored power points (see Artificing, above). Some rare materials are natural "mana vessels."
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Time:</span> <span class="c6">Generally speaking, the more complex the magical feat desired, the greater the time required in preparing. This is usually true of powerful spells as well. Complex, powerful spells should take a lot of time to prepare. You can trade Time for Difficulty Level, if you wish. The less time you take in preparing the magical incantation, enchantment, or other feat, the greater the Difficulty Level. Likewise, increasing the preparation and casting time may, at the GM's option, lower the Difficulty Level.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Materials:</span> <span class="c6">If the GM wishes, magical feats may require the use of materials related to the effects desired; sulphur or coal for fire, a feather for a flying spell, and so on. Some magical feats may be performed with nothing more than the magician's concentration or some words of power; others may require rare and precious materials.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="GenericNoIndent">
      <span class="StrongEmphasis">Modifiers:</span> <span class="c6">The GM may apply any modifiers desired. Examples include bonuses for using special materials (or using materials at all if not normally required); for performing magic in naturally magical surroundings; for applying any "laws of magic" the GM allows (if they have the Wizardry skill). Penalties may be applied for distracting circumstances, or the GM may require a Willpower roll for the mage to avoid becoming distracted and possibly losing control of the magic he's wielding.</span>

    </h4>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      The GM judges whether a feat is within the character's capabilities - if not, she should warn the player that attempting greater magics than the character is ready for is dangerous. The GM also determines what the actual result will be. Magic in Fantasy Fudge is an art, not a science; and the same "spell" cast in the same way may have varying results.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      In general, the greater the success in performing a magical feat, the closer to the desired effects the results will be. Spectacular successes may carry unexpected benefits, such as less time required to cast, lower power point cost, and the like. Abysmal failures should be spectacular, as well. Use your imagination, but don't allow the results to outright kill the character (unless he's a sorcerer)! Less abysmal failures will produce unexpected and possibly unwanted results, including greater power point cost with little or nothing to show for it.

    </h4>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      It's a good idea to take some time before play to work out some "standard" spells a scholarly mage is likely to use. Ask the player what spells the character is likely to have sought out, and work out some sample Difficulty Levels, Mana costs, and required time and materials for those spells. Feel free to "steal" spells from other games to help build a spell list. Consider the spell's desired affect rather than the actual game mechanics used in the game it was designed for, and base the difficulty and power levels on that.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Spell descriptions should be considered guidelines rather than strict definitions of spell effects and costs. Magical feats and their results are meant to be improvised by the Gamemaster as well as by the character.

    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      When a cleric with Divine Favor calls on his deity, make an Unopposed action roll against the specific Clerical Magic skill (see <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secffunopposed">Unopposed Actions</a>). On a Good or better result, the cleric's petition for divine favor is answered. For clerical skills where exact results aren't quantified (such as Healing), the better the rolled result, the better the answer to the prayer. For example, a Good result may reduce one wound by one wound level, while a Superb result could heal an injured character entirely.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      On a Fair or Mediocre result, the favor simply isn't granted. On a Poor or worse result, the deity may be angry with the cleric. The GM should consider the character's recent actions, especially in regard to the cleric's religious beliefs. If there are any reasons for the cleric's deity to be less than satisfied with service rendered, this is the time for that to become abundantly clear. If the cleric's behavior has been exemplary (so far as the deity is concerned), a failure simply means the deity was busy with other things, or considered the favor unimportant (or counter to its own desires) for some reason.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      For weapons, armor, and other equipment likely to be used in combat situations, the player or GM should determine Offensive and Defensive Damage Factors.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Damage Factors are simply the sum of damage-related modifiers for each weapon or armor type. These factors will be used to determine damage points and wound levels in combat (see <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secffwounds">Wounds</a>, section).
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">Sample "Wound Factors" are detailed on in section</span> <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secwoundfactors"><span class="Internetlink">4.5.3</span></a><span class="c6">. Use these to determine the "Offensive Damage Factor" for each character/weapon combination.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      For example, a character with Good Strength wielding a longsword would have an Offensive Damage Factor of +4 (+1 for Strength; +2 for a large one-handed weapon; +1 for sharpness). A character with Fair Strength wielding the same weapon would have an ODF of +3 (no Strength bonus). Remember to include any bonuses or penalties due to Scale when dealing with non-human combatants.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Then determine the character's "Defensive Damage Factor" for both "unarmored" and "armored" (if the character possesses armor). Modifiers range from +0 for no armor to +4 or more for heavy or magical armor. Scale and Gifts such as Tough Hide can also affect a character's Defensive Damage Factor.

    </h2>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      There are two types of actions in Fantasy Fudge - Opposed Actions, and Unopposed Actions.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      A fight between two creatures will most often be resolved as a series of Opposed Actions.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      An attempt to climb a cliff will most often be resolved as an Unopposed Action. The Gamemaster sets the "Difficulty Level" that must be met or surpassed for the action to succeed.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Note that very easy actions should be automatic; no need to roll. Likewise with impossible actions; the character just can't do it, and will fail in the attempt no matter how lucky the player is with dice.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      If the character doesn't have an appropriate skill to attempt a task, the GM may allow the player to roll on the default level for that skill (usually Poor). The GM may call for a roll against an attribute instead of a skill whenever it seems appropriate (asking for an Agility check rather than a Climbing check, for example), although an unskilled character should get a negative modifier to the dice roll.

      If you have Fudge dice, roll four of them instead. The result (from -4 to +4) is used as a modifier to a skill or character trait.

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      The Gamemaster sets a Difficulty Level for any unopposed action. This includes most ranged weapon combat - it's difficult for a character to actually hinder someone's attempt to fire at him, although if he has Quick Reflexes he could attempt to dodge out of the line of fire.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The Difficulty Level should take into account everything but the character's skill (and modifiers to that skill provided by equipment or character condition, including injuries). A task with a Difficulty Level of Poor is very easy, while something with a Difficulty Level of Superb is very hard. For legendary feats, set the Difficulty Level even higher (Superb +2, for example). When in doubt, set the Difficulty Level to Fair. That will give a character with a Fair skill a 62% chance of succeeding.
    </p>

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      When characters engage in opposed actions (including hand-to-hand combat), the players of each contestant roll the dice, add the indicated modifiers to the appropriate skill level, and compare the results. The GM rolls for all NPCs.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Relative Degree measures the difference between the results. If one character has a Good success in an Opposed Action, and the second character has a Mediocre success, the Relative Degree is +2 from the winner's perspective, and -2 from the loser's perspective. In combat, the winner adds the Relative Degree to his Offensive Damage Factor to determine the number of damage points inflicted.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      If it helps, you can convert the characters' combat skills to their numerical equivalents before adding all modifiers (including the random dice roll). Alternatively, put your finger on the Terrible - Superb Trait Scale list, and move up one line for every +1 or down one line for every -1.

    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      In Fudge, a combat "round" can be defined as the Gamemaster wishes. Fantasy Fudge assumes one "round" (roll of the dice) equals about 3 seconds of combat action. Actions occur simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Combat can be resolved as an Unopposed action if it involves ranged combat, a combatant being caught unawares (giving a "free attack" to the opponent), or a "cannon-fodder" type of NPC (see <a target="_self" class="Internet20link" href="#secffcombatspecialcircumstances">Special Circumstances</a>, below). Otherwise, treat combat as a series of Opposed Actions.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The players of characters engaged in opposed actions will roll the dice once each combat round; the result determines the winner of that round.

    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      A Terrible hit never damages the target, even if it beats the opponent's sub-Terrible result.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      When multiple opponents attack a single target, the lone fighter is at -1 to skill for each foe beyond the first. The player rolls once; compare the result with each of the opponents' rolls. The solo combatant has to defeat or tie all of the opponents in order to inflict a wound. If he beats all of his foes, he may hit one of his choice. Otherwise, he can only wound another whose result is at least two levels below his. The lone fighter takes multiple wounds if two or more enemies hit him.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      Unlike "star" NPCs, who are treated much like PCs, "cannon fodder" opponents will always get results equal to their trait levels. You can treat this as an Unopposed Action with a Difficulty Level equal to the NPC's combat skill.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      When "cannon fodder" NPCs gang up on a player character, use the "multiple opponents" rule above, but compare the outnumbered fighter's result with the NPCs' combat skill levels (not "rolled degrees").

    </h3>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      A character may try to stun or knock out his opponent rather than wound her, in which case a Hurt result is called a "Stun" and the -1 penalty associated with being "Hurt" lasts for one combat round only. A Very Hurt result would be "Very Stunned" and the -2 penalty lasts 2 combat rounds. An "Incapacitated" result indicates the opponent has been knocked out.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      <span class="c6">A character may also pull his punches. The player simply announces the maximum wound level his character will inflict if he wins the combat round.

    </h2>
    <p class="Firstparagraph c7">
      A Situational Roll is used to show luck, outside events, or the overall situation. It isn't based on any character traits. Simply roll the dice. A Situational Roll of -2 gives a Poor result; the situation is not good.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      The GM can use a Situational Roll to determine anything from the weather to a non-player character's attitude.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody c7">
      A Situational Roll can also be used to check a creature's "morale" during combat, especially when the creature is first wounded, and again if it becomes Very Hurt. A -1 or worse Situational Roll in the midst of combat may mean that the NPC will try to surrender or run away. You may add the NPC's current modifiers due to wounds to the "morale" roll. A Hurt creature with a -1 Situational Roll would actually be experiencing a Poor reaction to the combat, and would probably be doing whatever it could to get out of the fight….

      The basilisk, sometimes called the cockatrice by peasants, is a grayish serpent that grows to no more than two feet in length. It has white markings on its head that resemble a crown. Popular legend holds that the basilisk can kill with a mere glance, but this is untrue. The basilisk's danger lies in its venom. The venomous breath of a basilisk withers plants, scorches the earth and can kill any creature up to the size of an elephant.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      In combat, a basilisk breathes a nearly invisible, cone-shaped cloud of venom that affects foes up to fifteen feet away. Any living creature caught in the cloud must make a Health roll at Great Difficulty or be immediately slain.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Basilisks are also dangerous in melee combat. Any blow that successfully damages the creature can cause the creature's foul venom to pass up through the weapon and affect the wielder. Any time a Basilisk is struck with a melee weapon, the GM should roll a dF. On a roll of -1, the victim must make a Health roll as above or die.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      A basilisk is created from an egg that is laid by a cockerel and then incubated by a toad in a dung heap.

      Ghosts are the leftover psychic residue of someone who has perished. Generally speaking, there is no physical method of removing or harming them. Some ghosts can be put to rest if a special task is completed. Usually the completion of the task is what makes the spirit hang around after its original owner perished. Ghosts are generally resentful creatures and their deep emotional disturbance puts animals at unease.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Ghosts may be influenced, confined, banished, or released by various applications of Clerical Magic or Scholarly Magic (especially Shamanism or Necromancy).

      Ghouls (also know as Ghûls and Raveners) are once-human creatures whose minds have been destroyed. They have grey, jellylike flesh, yellow fangs, and filthy, broken nails which infect their victims with a sinister toxin.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Ghouls usually inhabit underground lairs near graveyards and similar places, where a supply of their noxious "food" may be found. Ghouls usually travel in packs of 3-12, with the most powerful and intelligent member as a leader. Their usual prey is carrion, but they will attack living humans if driven to it by hunger or by a powerful master.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Ghouls attack with their claws and teeth in a mindless frenzy. The poison in their claws drains vitality. The victim must make a Health roll, difficulty level Fair, or lose one level of health per combat round. Victims reduced to below Terrible Health become stiff and helpless.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Any human succumbing to a ghoul attack will be taken to their lair and buried. This live internment, in addition to the ghoulish poison, deranges the mind and causes physical changes that result in the victim becoming a ghoul. If sufficiently hungry, the ghouls may simply devour the victim.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Ghouls can be turned by the Repel Undead Clerical Magic skill, difficulty level Good. The clerical Ward ability keeps ghouls completely at bay. A clerical Healing can neutralize the poison if a victim has not entirely become a ghoul.

      These giant, carnivorous worms grow to be 150 long. They can bore through solid rock and are a menace to explorers in deep caverns.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      A worm's favorite attack is to stick its head out of a hole and swallow any creature of Scale 6 or less. Victims may attempt to dodge (Opposed Action, Victim's Agility versus the worm's Combat Skill). If the worm wins, the victim is swallowed.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      A creature may attempt to attack a worm from the inside., difficulty level Terrible (any attack of Terrible or better has a chance of doing damage) and DDF +1. There is little room to swing weapons. 15 points of cumulative damage done to the same area within the worm allows a victim to cut an escape hole, or might cause the worm to regurgitate.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Meanwhile, the victim is being digested. He or she takes a Scratch each combat round after being swallowed. If the victim has no Scratch boxes left, the Scratch will be a Hurt; if there are no Hurt boxes left on the victim's wound track, the result will be Very Hurt, and so on until death.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      If attacked from the rear, a giant worm will lash out with a bone-like stinger on its tail. It can do this the same round as attempting to swallow.

      Goblins are short (4 tall), evil humanoids that are found in wild forests or mountainous areas. Goblins are tribal and matriarchal. A tribe will normally consist of between 50 and 200 individuals. The leader of the tribe is usually a female of prodigious size and foul temperament.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Goblins are not particularly fearsome opponents in battle unless they are backed by overwhelming numbers or led by a charismatic general. Goblin tribes go through periods of very high birth rates every 5-10 years. This results in periodic invasions of surrounding lands by hordes of goblins on the move due to overpopulation and starvation.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Goblins fear and hate dwarves, since dwarves often enslave them and put them to work in their mines. The average goblin is armed with a wicked-looking serrated short sword and protected by a patchwork of leather armor.

      Its origins shrouded in mystery, the hydra is one of the most feared creatures. It appears as a large reptile, with many heads. Its regeneration makes it nearly unstoppable and its appetite is insatiable.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Each of a hydra's head can attack independently. For combat purposes, treat each head as a scale +2 creature whose teeth do +5 damage due to sharpness and strength.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Any wound of Incapacitated or Near Death inflicted on a head severs it from its neck. A new head will regenerate to replace the lost one. If the hydra makes a Superb Health check, two heads are regenerated. The regeneration process takes 4 combat rounds. A Hurt or worse wound inflicted by fire will prevent regeneration. Magic weapons may have similar effects.

      The hyeena is a horrible beast that resembles a large hound with a spiny ridge running along its back. It lives in tombs or catacombs and feeds on the dead. It will also dig up graves in the search for bodies. Some hyeenas stalk rural areas by night and prey on shepherds or late travelers.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      The hyeena has an unusual magical defense. Any creature that treads on a hyeena's shadow is immediately struck dumb and unable to speak. The effect lasts until the hyeena is killed or an hour has passed.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      The hyeena also has an uncanny talent for imitating the human voice, and uses this trick to lure its prey into an ambush.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Alchemists prize the hyeena's eyes because they can be distilled into small stones that can be used to foretell the future. An alchemist will pay a good fee for a pair of hyeena eyes if they are fresh or have been properly preserved in salt or strong alcohol.

      Imps are small demonic entities, which are either summoned or sent to this plane to aid a sorcerer or priest in some evil scheme. Imps come in many shapes, from man-like to grotesque.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Imps are skilled in Demonic Magic, which works the same way Scholarly Magic does. Demonic Magic excels at magical feats that cause confusion and misery. Most imps have 5 magical power points, and can channel 1- or 2-point spells.

      Medusae are cursed by gods. In ages past, the mother of all medusae compared her own beauty with that of the gods. For this, she and all her descendants were made so hideous, that any who saw them were turned to stone. (Any character who sees a medusa's face must make a Willpower check at a Great Difficulty level, or turn to stone.)

    <p class="Textbody">
      A medusa may attempt to take residence in an old villa or abandoned home. There, slowly but surely, a statue garden will begin to grow. The services of a hero may be needed to find a way of killing the poor creature. It has been rumored that when a medusa is slain, her victims return to the flesh.

      Rathent are odd creatures, most likely the result of some magical hybridization gone awry. They resemble humanoid birds, with large, curved beaks and offset eyes. Feathers cover their head, upper torso and arms. Their plumage is generally dark or mottled and unkempt and greasy. Many Rathent have hands ending talon-like claws. Most Rathent have human-like leg structure. Rare individuals will have bird-like legs or vestigial wings, and are generally regarded as gruk (retard or throwback). This is a reflection of cultural bias rather than actual ability or intelligence.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      The structure of Rathent society is loosely tribal with the strongest or most cunning being the skwarka (chieftain). The skwarka leads the tribe in battle and receives the most prestige and breeding privileges.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Rathent are extremely protective of their females, as they have a relatively low birthrate. Only one in five members of a typical Rathent tribe are female.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Rathent males serve as hunters and generally engage in banditry, thievery, and murder to eke out an existence. They are cowardly scavengers by nature and will feed on carrion with glee when there is nothing better.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Most Rathent provide only for themselves, but offer tribute to the skwarka and his harem. Warriors that do not pay tribute regularly to the skwarka are either exiled or more likely killed.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Rathent may be encountered in semi-civilized areas on the outskirts of forests and mountains. Their villages are clusters of rude tree houses similar to nests in structure. The skwarka's nest is the largest and centrally located, and is built into the largest tree available.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Rathent have fair craftsmanship skills, but rarely produce anything of exceptional quality. Most of their weaponry is scavenged or stolen. When left to their own means they will produce javelins, war darts, and spears. Rathent armor is usually cobbled together from bits and pieces scavenged in their raids.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Some Rathent have an innate talent for simple magic. Clerical Magic and Hedge Magic is most common. Scholarly Magic (Elementalism or Necromancy) is also possible, but no Rathent will have more than one level of the Magical Talent: Scholarly Magic Gift. Rathents with Magical Talent are known as kuzkwa. Most are female. All magically talented Rathent are sterile and considered sexless. Many are also albino. These Rathent serve as shamans and spiritual advisors.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Rathent spirituality is a grim affair centered around the malevolent figure Kzukwa-skwark (Old Lord Dread). Homage is paid to this fearsome entity by murdering as many non-Rathent as possible. This ensures that the afterlife will be only moderately painful, rather than an eternity of anguish and torture.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Rathent have an irrational attraction to shiny objects, and will often quarrel over relatively useless objects that glitter.

      Ratlings are small humanoid creatures whose head, claws and tail look like those of a rat. Their legs are also more ratlike than human. Ratlings have a low life expectancy due to disease resulting from poor living conditions. Ratlings can speak as well as humans, and usually speak the local dominant language. Their claws are dexterous enough to allow a Ratling to use equipment made for humans.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Ratlings were created by a Grand Mage who later allowed his experiments to leave his laboratory. In the few years since their creation, the Ratlings have established themselves amid the slums and backways of the city.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      The GM may involve Ratlings in the city's political scene if desired. Examples: The local ruler has placed a bounty on Ratling skins; Ratlings are active in the Thieves' or Beggars' Guilds; etc.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      The GM may adjust Ratlings to be smaller and more ratlike, if she likes. Suggested Scale: -5 or less (remember to adjust Offensive and Defensive Damage Factors).

      Time and time again, necromancers turn to dead humanoids when trying to inexpensively create tireless, fearless guardians. Corpses are versatile, readily available, and the once-living bones lend themselves well to enchantment. A lesser nether-spirit is bound to the dead bones, animating them and providing a rudimentary, malevolent intelligence. The resulting creatures need no sustenance, are infinitely patient, and obey the commands of their creators without question. They are often set to guard tombs, fortresses, and hiding places of all sorts.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      The Restless Dead appear as piles of old bones scattered around the places they guard. They have no odor (prior to enchantment, the corpses are usually stripped of all flesh by being placed onto anthills or in maggot pits). It takes a Perception roll of Great or above to detect the thin webwork of sigils covering the bones from any distance.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      When anyone or anything comes near, the bones reassemble into malevolent, skeletal forms and spring into action.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Though not terribly strong, the Restless Dead are agile and tenacious. They are often equipped with rusty, patchwork armor (+1), shields (+1), and various weapons such as maces, swords, axes, and spears (+1 to +3).

      The wall crawler resembles nothing so much as a nightmarish cross between a giant centipede and a black, furry caterpillar. A wall crawler is usually 1 to 1 6 long and, except for its head, is completely covered with 6 long black spines. The crawler skitters along on sixteen feet that are equipped with an array of tiny hook-like protrusions. These allow the creature to travel over almost any surface. It can traverse a cave ceiling or dungeon wall as easily as it does the ground.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Wall crawlers are found in dark places and fill the role of scavengers, devouring the dead and sometimes the dying. Wall crawlers rarely attack living creatures unless in defense or if the creature is badly injured. They are usually encountered in groups of 7-12 individuals.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      In combat, a wall crawler can deliver a painful bite that sometimes becomes infected. Its real danger, however, lies in the spines that cover its body. These spines are sharp and can easily pierce cloth or the leather sole of a boot. The hollow spines contain a toxin that causes confusion and hallucinations. If an adventurer contacts a spine, he must make a Fair difficulty Health Roll. If he fails the roll, he will become confused and disoriented within minutes. For the next 2-4 hours he will be effectively incapacitated by hallucinations, unable to fight or find his way without assistance.

      Zombies are walking corpses, with shreds of flesh still attached. They are animated through evil magics (Necromancy, Sorcery, or some evil Clerical Magic) and obey the instructions of their creators. Zombies continue to decay, giving them a vile stench and a horrifying appearance. They may also be disease carriers. The GM may require characters exposed to zombies to make a Health Roll (Difficulty Level Mediocre) to avoid contracting some suitably noxious disease.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Zombies have no initiative, relying on their master for instructions. Feeling no fear or pain, they make excellent shock troops. They are almost indestructible, requiring a Near Death result to "kill" them.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Zombies are unable to wield weapons. They attack with their hands and nails, pummeling their opponents with mindless intensity. They will attempt to surround and overwhelm difficult opponents.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Zombies are unintelligent (mindless), and so have no speech, skills, etc., although they may moan while attacking. They may be repelled with the Repel Undead Clerical Magic skill (Difficulty Level Mediocre).
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Zombies usually inhabit cemeteries, abandoned churches, necromancers' strongholds, or temples to evil gods.

      An evil priest, sorcerer, or necromancer can create a Zuvembie by draining the life force from a man-sized humanoid creature via arcane magics and poisons. A Zuvembie's flesh becomes hard and its skin leathery as a result of the process, and Zuvembie bodies do not show the decay of true zombies. They retain some intelligence, unlike zombies, and can understand relatively complex instructions. They wield weapons (albeit clumsily), and may retain some of the skills they maintained in life, but reduced by 2 levels.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      As with zombies, Zuvembies are immune to pain and require a Near Death result to "kill" them.
    </p>
    <p class="Textbody">
      Zuvembies usually inhabit their creators' residence. They may be Repelled with Great difficulty.
